      "very lite and cooling.\n",
      "I don't know how I lived without this stuff!! Love love love how it makes my skin feel. It has made a huge difference for my skin and I plan to keep this is my regimen for a long time.\n",
      "Wow! Pretty good moisture ! I like the fact that this is a moisturizer WITHOUT OIL!! I have gone to  various dermatologists it seems like all my life for acne & they always tell me to use an \"oil free moisturizer \" since I have combination skin.  This is nice feeling , not heavy & seems to add hydration & not oil!!\n",
      "This stuff is AMAZING. I would recommend highly--the eye cream too!\n",
      "The Hydro Boost Gel cream gives the skin a cool moist feeling. I recommend it!\n",
      "This made me break out like no tomorrow (I'm in my 30's, with oily, non-sensitive skin.)  I really wanted to like this product & was so excited to try it but I could not have been more disappointed.\n",
      "I don't see big difference after using this product.\n",
      "its okay. didnt live up to the hype. wouldnt buy it again.\n",
      "nothing to write home about and not enough moisturizing for winter.  I'm 45 and life in Maryland where its fairly cold in winter...need something more hydrating\n",
      "This is a good product.  It didn't take 10 years off my age but it did make it better.  Other moisturizers make my make up bead when applied but this one didn't . It has a nice feel to it, as well.\n",
      "The gel itself is very refreshing and lightweight, so I liked it at first. But after maybe 30 minutes or so my skin felt tight and dry again. I just didn't feel like my skin was getting the hydration that was promised!\n",
      "Love this stuff.\n",
      "love it\n",
      "Wonderful product\n",
      "Had extremely dry skin due to an allergic reaction. This product was great at repairing and healing my dry skin.\n",
      "great cream!  I have combo skin and have always been scared to use something too heavy.  Recently I started using retin-A micro for acne, and my face was peeling even though I was using my clinique dramatically different get moisturizer morning and night.  After switching to this at the recomendation of my dermatologist, the peeling has stopped.  I am very pleased with the way this is absorbed into my skin.  It is light and has no fragrance, which is perfect.\n",
      "Feels light and silky and has the best fresh scent. I reviewed this product for Influenster and fell in love with it.\n",
      "My skins feels so much better. I have very dry skin and it hasn’t made it go away completely but it feels much better. I apply twice a day and put make over the top.\n",
      "ordered june 22 and arrived june 25.  the gel cream looks used, box was torn when arrived.  no white plastic layer on top of cream inside lid.\n",
      "This works amazing for my face! I have super sensitive skin, and everything makes me break out but this doesn't and it keeps my skin moisturized for a long period of time! Love love it! Will definitely be buying it again.\n",
      "I was pining after this due to the pretty packaging but I ultimately bought it to save money on a product I thought would be comparable to a clinique moisturizer. Boy was I wrong! The cream feels nice and smells clean, but it doesn't seem to leave my skin moisturized much at all. Even in the first five minutes after, which is when other moisturizers tend to leave my skin the softest. My face feels as greasy as a pizza afterward too, and I seem to have a blackhead colony on my chin now. Would not purchase again.\n",
      "I will buy this again. Non greasy and perfect for my oily skin. Light weight and easy to apply with sunblock or use under makeup.\n",
      "I bought this product after trying my daughter purchase. It has helped with the dry patches I get on my face. I am on jar #4😄😘😍\n",
      "I'd like give it a 3.5 star rating because I like the way my skin feels when I put it on and it stays moisturized for hours. What I don't like is the chemical smell. Ever time  I use it I get an uneasy feeling about what kind of chemicals I'm putting  on my skin.\n",
      "Absolutely love this! I originally came looking for a hydrating cream because I had a facial done and was told my face needed hydration. Ofcourse the cream at the salon was 175 and I was not going to pay that amount. Needless to say this hydro boost is extremely affordable and my skin is feeling fabulous.\n",
      "I really like how it works, makes my face feel soft & moisterized\n",
      "no comment\n",
      "My skin has never been so soft, and it has not irritated my rosacea.\n",
      "Love this product.\n",
      "Works okay, but you dont get a ton, not super moisturizing unless you use a lot. I prever cerave moisturizing cream in the huge tub from riteaid\n",
      "BEST FACE LOTION FOR MORNING AND NIGHT EVER. Very ideal for healing scars and diminishing redness overnight.\n",
      "Like this product a lot,  very light and smells nice\n",
      "Love\n",
      "I was recommended by Curology to use this. It works very well for my sensitive skin. I also use Thayers witch hazel, levenrose rose water, with Dynarex Non-Sterile Non Woven Sponge, 4x4 Inch, 200 Count instead of cotton balls (I cut in half to get more usage), stratia liquid gold, and missha sunscreen. this along with curology has helped my skin immensely.\n",
      "Best moisturizer out there! Love the entire line!\n",
      "I love the fact you only need a little bit to go a long way. The price of the product is outstanding. I am very grateful that I was able to test this product and be able to help more viewers with this product. The gel does not leave your face greasy like most of them normally do. I would definitely buy this again in the future.I received the bottle from influenster complementary and tested Neutrogena Hydro Boost water gel for free, but all opinions are your own.\n",
      "This tore my face up!!!!  I don't have sensitive skin and this burnt me when I put it on!  My face feels like I have a dry mask on.  Threw it out immediately\n",
      "I like this stuff.  Supposedly Kerry Washington swears by it.\n",
      "Very nice product. Didn't break out as some reviews have said, but THIS works for me to ADD ON to my normal beauty regime.\n",
      "Love this product.\n",
      "It has taken away dry skin , which is why I purchased it.Skin feels so very soft, like it use to.\n",
      "Great for moisture especially at nighttime!  No harsh smell, and very light.  Doesn't feel greasy or heavy at all.\n",
      "I love it\n",
      "Got it for my mom who is about 50 Years old.She has patchy dry skin and has tried many creams and lotions. This is an absolutely fantastic product. Will buy again.\n",
      "Not a lot of smell and absorbs quick. Good base. Great for hydrating skin during the cold winter months. Wont go without it.\n",
      "I really like this stuff. Let it absorb / dry and then continue with your normal routine. It's not greasy, which is why I would stop using other face creams.I use this during the day and an oilier product at night. At 57, I realize that some oil is necessary.I have really sensitive skin, especially as I grow older, but this stuff has caused zero issues. I've been using this for over 2 months. It's totally subjective, but I think it's helpful for very fine lines and some crepiness (sp?). I would never expect a face cream to do anything amazing - that's not realistic. This does as much as I would hope.\n",
      "I have unhydrated flaky gross skin... I know, I know, I need to drink water!  I'm always looking for hydrating face products.  Most I've found leave my skin greasy or feel heavy not to mention expensive.  This gel cream is a dream! Although I probably need extra dry, I got it mainly because its Fragrance-free, Oil-Free, Dye-free, which the normal water gel doesnt list.  It is ultra lightweight and not at all greasy.  My face actually feels like I splashed it with water when I put it on. Unlike other \"moisturizers\" that just sit on top of your skin, this has hyaluronic acid which \"locks in\" moisture.  Pro beauty tip: Apply it to damp skin (right after the shower) to give an extra boost of moisture.\n",
      "It's pretty amazing moisturize the skin without any oily look!\n",
      "it's terrific!!\n",
      "It does not work the best for mature skin and the neck.\n",
      "This cream is one of those creams I  just can not live with out it. it is lightly scent, non greasy and makes your face and hands feel great. it does not require a lot of cream to make your face feel unbelievable. My husband uses it for his chaffed legs and I use it for my elbows which are constantly dry and itchy. wen you feel the cream, is  like a silky touch and when it is applied to your skin you get the same results. I use it once per day and feel that my face looks healthier and shiny almost younger.  after working in the garden I love to use it on my hands as they feel like I just had a manicure massage. works amazing on fry feet too. even though that is not what it is made for\n",
      "I've used this stuff for about a week and at first it was fine but the past few days I've noticed a change in my skin and I only just realized it's because I've added this to my routine. This product has turned my normal, not dry skin to scaly and red. Almost like an acid burn! It's awful! It burns when I put it on and I woke up this morning to peeling, red skin. I can't even put on makeup or concealer without more flaky skin. I don't have dry skin normally so maybe that's my mistake but it was given to me free as a gift and I figured it would just add moisture to my skin. Not true - it's had the opposite affect! I'm discontinuing use immediately.\n",
      "I have extra-dry skin, and have tried a range of products. This one beats out the high-range creams each and every single time. I don't think I'll ever use another moisturizer again, and I hope Neutrogena will never discontinue Hydro Boost!\n",
      "I wish this product included sun screen then it will be absolutely fantastic!, makes your skin soft, hydrated and with healthy looking I use it before make up, you have to let it be absorb by your skin before applying your make up\n",
      "This stuff is magic. Love it. Hydration without the breakouts!\n",
      "AMAZING. Helps my skin soooo much. Feels extremely refreshing. Use in the morning and at night.\n",
      "Moisturizes my skin and it feels smoother every morning when I wake up. Works great!\n",
      "Im a 26 year old man with dry sensitive man and it works great for my skin. I generally switch products alot. Im always looking for something that I can put on my face that give it the moisture it needs without being greasy, oily, or filmy. Its something totally different to lotions and other creams it absorbs so well. I have noticed that on days where ive missed using it my skin isnt dry/flakey anymore but this was after 2 solid weeks of using twice a day. All this being said i subscribed cause i need this in my life!\n",
      "Nice.\n",
      "I currently use this moisturizer and have been for a couple months now.  I have definitely seen an improvement in my skin, but I've also made some other changes.  I started using an acne cream I got from Curology.  If you don't know them look them up.  (I've been seeing good results). Anyway, their site recommended this moisturizer.  I do seem to go through it quickly?  And it's not that cheap...but whatareya gonna do?\n",
      "The best!!!\n",
      "Keeps my skin moisturized without feeling heavy.\n",
      "The gel cream is odorless which is nice; goes on smooth and doesn't leave any greasy after feel; however, the main ingredient is listed near the end of the list..which means LOW %. It's basically dimethicone and silicone and water. I did like that it was quite good after shaving and did moisturize my face. I just wish there was more of the main ingredient!\n",
      "I was using so many moisturizers before I found this stuff. Every night I put this on my face and it cleared up my eczema within days and hasn't returned!\n",
      "Non irritating, nice moisturizer.\n",
      "What can I say I love this stuff! It makes my face so smooth and radiant I will keep using this. The eye cream and face cream both they make my fine lines less noticeable and my dry flakey skin is gone! I have tried so many different moisturizers and the others just don't compare. This is by far the best!\n",
      "Love this stuff!! Took a day or two for my sr survive skin to adjust, but feels wonderful and complexion is clear through the day.\n",
      "This is for real the one and only face cream/gel that actually does what is says it will do. I have been using it for almost 2 months (need to re-order) and I see a change in my skin. I started off with some sun damage and wrinkles around my eyes and since using this product I do/t even see the wrinkles and my skin feels amazing. I also rub the remainder on my hands because, Why not. You will not regret purchasing this product\n",
      "I have very dry and sensitive skin. This is the best drugstore moisturizer I've ever found! I've used it twice a day all winter and I have nothing but good things to say about it. I used to spend more money on Clinique gel moisturizers but now that I've found this, I'm saving some $.\n",
      "Dried my Tzone out...  itched all day.. Going back to lab series.  I was hoping for a cheaper alternative but this stuff didn't work for me.\n",
      "moisturizing, fast aborb\n",
      "Thanks to Influenster and Neutrogena, I got to try this full size product for free. And hooooooboy do I love it. It's light weight, sure. It feels kinda watery, sure. But it QUENCHES my skin. I have an oily forehead and nose, but right around the edges of my mouth and on my cheeks, it can get so dry that I flake. After my morning routine, I've switched to using this as my moisturizer and buhbye flakes! Plus, my oily zone is not so oily feeling, while still feeling refreshed and hydrated!I want to try the thicker cream one as I think I'll need that come winter, but this feels fantastic and keeps me moisturized throughout my day so far!\n",
      "this is a miracle product! I love it for the hotter months, especially. I wear it under SPF in the daytime and apply before using retin A at night. it has totally solved the retin A response i was having; redness and flaking be gone!\n",
      "This is a necessity every day for my skin. It makes it feel so hydrated and soft. Game changer for my skin.\n",
      "I have normal skin and this absorbs quickly (which is nice) but my skin does not feel hydrated after at all. I end up putting my other moisturizer on top because my skin feels dry. Would not recommend, especially if you have any form of dry skin.\n",
      "My favorite mostuirizer high-end or drugstore. I have and will continue to repurchase this product time and time again.\n",
      "Use every nightRecommend\n",
      "This specific product was recommended to me by my dermatologist who gave me a small sample. I love gel-type formulas and this is now my favorite. Love it. Soaks in quickly. Never feels greasy. I can layer this on multiple times and it still seems to soak right into my skin. I've already bought a 2nd jar.\n",
      "I have extremely dry skin. This moisturizer has worked wonders for my face. My face feels soft, hydrated and supple. I've tried tons of moisturizers and this is by far the best.\n",
      "Very thin moisturizer.\n",
      "This stuff is magic!!!! My skin gets extremely dry and flakey in this harsh windy cold weather and this makes my skin feel like new. And it is SO light weight!\n",
      "Great for my dry skin.  It is odorless.\n",
      "Love this! 5 stars because it does exactly what the label says. I've used this morning and night since I got it a couple of days ago and my skin is incredibly smooth, hydrated, and baby soft. I have extremely dry/flaky skin and this cures it. Can't wait to use it in winter too. Goes on nicely with no greasy/lotiony feel or shine. Doesn't break out my skin. Used it on my neck too and it actually smoothed out some of my neck wrinkles. Going to get one for my mom too!\n",
      "I love it\n",
      "I LOVE Amazon's Subscribe and Save program - I'm saving tons of money and lots of time. Best thing I've done for my face in years.\n",
      "Amazing\n",
      "I have only used this a couple of times and have really liked it so far. Makes my skin feel soft!\n",
      "cool and creamy.  Like the feel of it.\n",
      "I have dry skin, and TBH this moisturizer made my skin even more dry. I would not call this a gel/cream but more like a lightweight moisturizer. However if you have oily skin this is the stuff for you!\n",
      "Works great for sensitive skin and I love that it is totally scentless.  I wish they would make the non-extra dry scentless too as it worked for extremely sensitive skin but I couldn't tolerate even the mild scent.\n",
      "This is some of the best cream I've found in a long time, and best of all its reasonably priced.\n",
      "It's not life-changing, but it definitely helps with my dehydrated skin at night. Very glad to add it to my skin care process, especially in the winter (which I missed most of this year!).\n",
      "Love it and will buy again.\n",
      "I have very dry skin so when I read the reviews I ordered and it has to be the best moisturizer I've ever used. I'm going to try their other products, hopefully they will be as good as this one is.\n",
      "I have super dry skin and this is the only moisturizer I will ever use. I hope they never change this formula!!!\n",
      "Love this Product!! Can't live without it!\n",
      "Olay regenerist better than Neutrogena\n",
      "Very happy with my purchase as usual! THANK-YOU\n",
      "In my 50's.  Excellent cream to use any time of day.  It doesn't leave a sheen like some do, nor does it have a heavy presence.  Definitely worth the money and probably better than some very expensive department store creams!  Try it!\n",
      "You need very little.  I use only on face and neck because it's expensive\n",
      "As far as the product is concerned, I really do love it. I'm combo more on the oily side and this does NOT make my face turn into a grease ball like others do. My only gripe is the cost.. Looking for an alternative based on that alone which is unfortunate.\n",
      "I got this product through Influentster in a voxbox and was SO excited to try it! I have dry, sensitive skin, and now in the harshness of winter it's SUPER dry and sensitive. I feel that this product is ideal for a light wash of hydration, but not a deep drink for VERY dry skin. I look forward to trying the other version for drier skin types! If you've used the neutrogena wipes in the hydrating formula, the scent is nearly identical. It's nice and light and fresh, nothing overwhelming!I've tried this in many ways: alone, with serums, with oil, under moisturizer, and over day creams. My favorite way so far is under my day cream as a light wash to add extra moisture and it works quite well like that. It's also splendid under makeup alone, as it dries quickly and leaves no residue! I don't recommend adding oil, it really gives no benefit and seems to break it down more than anything.If my skin is very dry, it will sting a bit to my skin, but it also leaves my skin very soft. I think if you have combo skin this would be PERFECT for you! Overall I like this product, and look forward to trying it in summer when I'm less dry. I think it's worth a try :3\n",
      "My complexion is clear and smooth.  It was extremely dry before using this product.\n",
      "I've been using this for a couple of weeks and it's nice - goes on smooth and makes my skin feel soft. It is between a a gel and a cream so it is a nice texture and is not greasy. Works well under make up and I also put it on at night in combination with Olay Regenerist. Honestly i don't know what the long term effects will be - but so far so good, and I think it is helping to keep my skin more hydrated and plump. It is very nice and I am satisfied with it for the price.\n",
      "Subscribed to this product for my wife. She enjoys it quite a bit. After going thru years of trying expensive brands like Estée Lauder and Elizabeth Arden, she finds out the oil free formulas offered by neutropenia works best for her skin. And the price is very reasonable as well.\n",
      "Good\n",
      "I have a hard time finding good facial products that are fragrance free which is a must for me due to allergies. This product is cool and feels wonderful first thing in the morning. It goes on silky smooth and seems to melt into my skin. There is no stickiness or residue. I absolutely love the feeling of my skin after using it. I've only been using it for a week or two so I can't attest to any noticeable changes in my skin's appearance but overall my skin feels great--plump and healthy.\n",
      "57 years young , looking better thanks to this . Love it!\n",
      "This product is amazing in the winter when your skin is super dry! It really helps repair your skin when you put it on before bed.\n",
      "I absolutely love this moisturizer.  You do not to use much of it at one time.  It’s very hydrating and my face feels very “fresh” after using it.\n",
      "Good as expected\n",
      "this is so good at hydrating, it's helping reverse years of neglecting to care for my face.\n",
      "The hydro boost gel cream is nice. It reminds me of Nivea after shave but without the added fragrance.Not bad so far. I will use it for a month after each shower and exfoliation to see if it makes a difference. I live in Colorado where its really dry year round. My skin is combination. I use many types of moisturizers. Rose hip oil, vasaline, Egyptian magic, aquafor, almond oil etc. I switch them around.This product is alright. I won't be purchasing agian. Not for my skin type. I like the Egyptian magic much more. This wasn't a terrible product. I could see it working better in a humid area.\n",
      "Wow.  I used this once and I noticed a considerable fading of fine lines and little wrinkles from winter skin.  It is VERY hydrating, but it is not greasy.  It didn't leave a film on my face or cake up at all.  I have a new go to!\n",
      "It's okay, I dont see a change in my skin\n",
      "I really love this moisturizer.  It has cured my dry skin with no irritation that I sometimes get with other brands.\n",
      "I would consider myself to have combination skin. It can sometimes be difficult to find a moisturizing product that doesn't cause me to breakout. After I had gotten sick and became dehydrated it was absolutely impossible to keep my face from being dry. I'd seen this product advertised on TV several times so I decided to give it a shot, thinking it would ultimately end up like other products I've tried. I was wrong!! After less than a week of using it day and night my skin felt so much better! I'm very happy that I decided to give it a try!!!\n",
      "great product\n",
      "I love this product, my skin feels so smooth.\n",
      "Love it!!\n",
      "Love this stuff! Perfect amount of hydration without leaving greasy residue. Absorbs quickly, feels refreshing, and good as a night cream or in the morning before makeup. I have combination skin type and it does not clog my pores.\n",
      "Bought this for my fiance and I because we both have dryness on our foreheads/noses. Works great!\n",
      "Love this stuff. I have a super oily t zone and I am drying every where else. It doesn’t add any oil and dries very soft and smooth. It feels very cooling and refreshing. I will be buying again!\n",
      "I like Nutragena products, I read an article in a woman's magazine once that compared them to top expensive products and they tested out ahead.\n",
      "This stuff is amazing! I was looking for a moisturizing face cream that didn't make my face feel heavy and greasy. I was skeptical when I first applied this product to my face because it wasn't greasy at all and I questioned how moisturizing it could be regardless of all the positive reviews I had read. Let me tell you...I have been using this about a month or so now and my skin looks better than it has in years! And it is a very gentle to my sensitive skin. I paid $17 and some change at Walmart for this product and it was well worth it! I couldn't be happier!\n",
      "I really enjoy using this moisturizer. It is very light & feels wonderful on my face. It is especially good for my dry sensitive skin. A great product that is well worth the price.\n",
      "This is absolutely the best moisturizer, I was skeptical because of the price but it has proven to be my best moisturizer for my extremely dry skin. I think I can even tell a difference in my fine lines. I have sensitive skin and no breakouts. I would like to have my a glow in the product.\n",
      "My wife loves this; she uses it nearly every night and the smell doesn't offend. It definitely has improved her skin and isn't oily at all.\n",
      "Does not really help extra dry skin especially in the winter. Had to put on muliple layers.\n",
      "It's a lovely package and the product smells nice, but it didn't work for me. Not only did it not work, but it cause my face to turn red in places and swelling that made me look like I'd been beaten up. I'm not prone to adverse reactions with skin cream, but I can't use this - I'm six days after the initial application, and still look dreadful, with skin flaking and minor swelling.\n",
      "I live in Alaska so just from the weather I suffer from very dry skin. Neutrogena's Gel Cream is my skin's savior! I love it!\n",
      "This product is amazing for the price! I Bought this due to Jonathan from queer eye recommending it, and I love it. It truly is a hydrating angel baby. Definitely go with this gel-cream and not the similar water gel product — the water gel has dye and fragrance added and is not even close to the quality of this product.\n",
      "Cause a mild reaction on my face. I use actives and I assume they increased sensitivity. That being said it's great for the body.Although mine didn't come w/ a safety seal. Not sure if this particular product would, since it's in a box.\n",
      "I had suffered from red, itchy, ugly eczema around my eyes and mouth for months. Sine I was already using expensive skin care products for dry and sensitive skin, allegedly appropriate for my age (56), it didn't come to my mind that they could be just not what my face needed. My doctor prescribed steroids, which made it better for 3 days, and then worse. I finally decided that my skin perhaps just needed a moisturizer (not oil or fat based products, as I had thought), and gave Neutrogena Hydro Boost Gel-Cream a try. The result was fabulous: Almost immediately, my skin felt smoother and less itchy, after 3 days the red spots were gone, and after a week I was not only back to normal, but better: This stuff does what the anti-aging and wrinkle-repair products I used before did not, it makes my skin look fuller and younger. Definitely a magic cure against dehydration!\n",
      "Company WONT tell you amount of hyaluronic acid in cream like other companies due.They probably pass the acid near the product . Other companies list the percentage and work much better .FOOLS GOLD!\n",
      "I bought this on accident when I was looking to buy another water gel moisturizer. Dont get wrong, this one is fine, but the gel-cream seems to clog my pores a bit. If you have any acne, use the water gel instead....its my holy grail\n",
      "I have dry, rosacea prone skin. This has really helped ease my problems. It feels so smooth and luxurious when you apply, and my skin really drinks it in. I've tried other Hyaluronic acid moisturizes at other price points, and this is my favorite. You need just a little each morning so this lasts quite a while.\n",
      "I love this moisturizer! It's not greasy, really light, and it cools my rosacea skin. I would recommend this to anyone with facial redness!\n",
      "It seems to take a ton of the product before my face feels moisturised.\n",
      "Nice gel texture and easily absorbs into skin.  Nice and light - I use it in the summer.\n",
      "I have psoriasis and eczema on my face and have super-sensitive skin and cannot live without this. No more dry flakes during Northern Wisconsin winters! It is not greasy and plumps up fine lines to make them almost disappear. No smell, which I love!\n",
      "This stuff is great for dry winter months when the regular Hydro Boost gel just doesn't cut it. A little bit goes a long way and it doesn't make my skin greasy.\n",
      "I have very dry skin and this product has been helping a lot, especially in the cooler weather. It sits well under make up and feels cool to the touch. I would like it better if it had a pump so I wouldn't have to touch all of the product when applying.\n",
      "Did not moisturize. Actually dried my skin out in both the already dry and the oily areas... I do not like the gel... Will be offering to my mom.\n",
      "This works wonders!\n",
      "(Husbands account)lol I absolutely love this product. By far my favorite moisturizer. Feels way different than regular moisturizer and dries and leaves my skin feeling hydrated. Highly recommend. Plus a little goes a long way!\n",
      "Very soft and full of moisture.  Safe on my very sensitive skin.  No fragrance.\n",
      "This is a case of the incredibly shrinking product. No, it's not smaller, but it's not as thick as it used to be. Keep products with their original contents and I'll pay more. Considering moving onto a better quality product.\n",
      "Very nice product!\n",
      "I had originally bought the non-extra dry skin Neutrogena Hydro Boost Gel.  I needed something extra so my face wouldn't feel so dry so i decided to give this one a try.  I like it.  The formula is lightweight and i've noticed my pores are smaller.\n",
      "My skin is acne-prone and has been kind of rough in texture and dry lately. My usual moisturizer wasn't cutting it. I've used this for around 2 weeks and it has made my face SO SOFT! It hasn't been irritating to my acne either. Works great under my makeup.\n",
      "does feel like i have stuff on my face. definitely makes me look and feel fresher and younger and my 52 years of age.\n",
      "I have extremely dry skin and this works perfect for me.\n",
      "I absolutely love this stuff for my dry skin! Works perfect in the winter months, not to thick for the summer. I have super dry skin and this leaves me so moisturized without being too heavy. Goes great under makeup. I’m on my 4th or 5th container.\n",
      "Living in Colorado, I get really dry skin--but only certain parts of my face succumb to the climate.  The rest is oily and acne prone, so I really have to be careful what I put on my face.  This stuff is amazing--lightweight and cool.  It soaks in very quickly and is not at all heavy.  It's like putting aloe gel on your face, but without the weird residue that sometimes leaves.  The scent is very neutral unlike some Neutrogena products I've used in the past, and most importantly, my skin doesn't freak out and actually feels hydrated.\n",
      "I have been using this for a few months, in order to give it a fair try.  Perhaps it would work for someone younger but I'm in my mid 60's and am really disappointed in this product.  Within minutes after application, my face is really dry and feels like I haven't applied any moisturizer.  In order for my face to feel somewhat hydrated, I have to reapply a second time.....twice a day.  It's time for me to find a replacement.\n",
      "I bought this when my Neutrogena Deep Moisture Night Cream ran out. I liked the Hydro Boost Gel Cream, but it did not work on my dry skin as well as the Night Cream did (that stuff works great, night or day - haha).  My face dries out pretty bad in the Winter months and I have to use something that will keep the dry spots from showing up all day.  After a week of using the Hydro Boost Gel Cream, I ended up going to a local store to buy some more of the Deep Moisture Night Cream.  I think the Hydro Boost Gel Cream will be perfect for Summer though when I'm looking for something lighter.\n",
      "love it. I already ordered it again. thanks!\n",
      "light feeling with a fresh light scent. soaks into my skin quickly and doesn't leave it feeling oily. will definitely buy again.\n",
      "My secret weapon. I'm a big skin care buff. But at the end of the day, if it's winter and my skin hates me, this is the answer. Always fixes the driest skin possible. It's probably excessive for every day use, but every girl needs this in her cabinet for the dry skin emergency and /or winter of hell.\n",
      "Amazing\n",
      "It's not the best product I have used for moisturizer but it's okay. Would I buy this again? Probably not. There are better products out there.\n",
      "This gel works.\n",
      "Love it.\n",
      "I wish I hadn't wasted my money on some of the other expensive creams and facial oils. This product is amazing and you can actually feel the difference after just one application :)\n",
      "My favorite product! It hydrates my skin without leaving my face feeling oily and sticky. My skin is very dry, I have tried so many products and this one has never let me down. I stock up on this :D\n",
      "Most creams or lotions leave an unflattering greasy appearance on my skin, like I have some kind of disease or maybe inferior genes. Not this stuff. It's light, gets rid of dryness, and I don't feel a residue on my skin.\n",
      "This is the only product that seems to keep my face moisturized. If you have dry sensitive skin & want odorless this is it.\n",
      "The product just wasn't for me, it felt just to  watery.\n",
      "Great product\n",
      "Great product! Hydrates very well without leaving a film or sticky feeling.\n",
      "Feels fine, slicks on nicely. I was looking for a dupe for cliniques gel moisturizer. However I will not buy again because --- as I find for most neutrogenia products--- it smells bad. This gel smells like the cheap, overly floral smell of a bathroom air freshener.\n",
      "Works very well for added moisture\n",
      "bought for my mom and she likes it a lot\n",
      "This is a fantastic product. It helped me moisturize my dry skin, and it never caused me to breakout. It was recommended to me by the dermatologists at [...]  along with a cleaning regiment that has worked well for me.\n",
      "I did not notice much of a difference with my dry skin\n",
      "I had dry patches on my skin and found this through Dr. Dray on YouTube. It’s a Heumectant sooooo apply onto WET SKIN and follow it with a moisturizer (I use Neutrogena Sensitive Skin)! It works so much better when used this way.  It made my dry patches go away and my skin is now incredibly soft and radiant.\n",
      "I have both the gel and the gel-cream.  I use the latter on the days I swim and the pool water dries up my skin.  No breakouts with either one, both absorb quickly, but the gel-cream dries a little bit shinier than the gel.\n",
      "This feels very good on the skin.\n",
      "Best moisturizer for the money.  With this my makeup goes on so smooth - no more cracking later in the day during the winter.\n",
      "wife loves it she uses it all the time and has reminded me to order more\n",
      "After approximately a month of using Hydro Boost Gel-Cream, I can honestly say this is one of the best moisturizing products.  There is no fragrance; I haven't had any breakouts (like with other products) and I haven't had the unpleasant enlargement of pores, as with other products (I have tried many!)This winter was horribly drying and abusive to my skin.  After a couple of times using Hydro Boost, my skin felt smooth, silky and soft.  It actually feels as if one can feel the moisture being pulled into the tissues... Dewy skin sensation.  Amazing!  Hyaluronic Acid is a moisture replacement miracle.This is my second purchase.  I will continue to use as long as Neutrogena continues to produce this fine product. :)\n",
      "Aside from being pricey, this stuff works wonders! Very few ingredients, which is great for my sensitive skin. Suuuuper hydrating. I wish they made this in a bigger size.\n",
      "my dermatologist recommended and its very good\n",
      "My favorite face lotion and for a good price here. When I run out I will probably by it here again.\n",
      "This was recommended by my dermatologist to put on top of a sunscreen based moisturizer. I love the texture and cooling effect. I have VERY dry skin.\n",
      "This is a wonderful gel cream! I became interested in using gel-based moisturizers when I tried Clinique's \"Moisture Surge Extended Thirst Relief\" - however, I wasn't willing to shell out over $20 per container. I needed a moisturizer in the evening to balance the harsh ingredients in my daily face wash (Dr. Brandt's \"Pores No More\"). This gel cream just did the trick. It dries quickly, a little goes a long way, and it doesn't irritate my combination skin (which would get dry in the T-Zone due to my face wash). The smell in the container is strong, but not unpleasant - just different, and possibly the smell you'd expect from a product that is gel - not oil - based. However, the smell doesn't linger on my face when applied. This is a really impressive product by Neutrogena! I will be re-purchasing.\n",
      "does not moisturize, sinks in, does not make my face feel soft,  I've found much cheaper Ponds cream works better\n",
      "Very good\n",
      "I have very dry skin and I think this product is exceptional. Hydrates my skin without the oils and breakouts. Leaves my skin with a glow and even tone. I would go as far as to say this product supersedes even the expensive designer products. (There is no strong scent that I have noticed.)\n",
      "One of my favorite products. Hydrates face without causing breakouts. Has really helped with my dark circles.\n",
      "ONE OF THE BEST PRODUCTS I HAVE USED AND THE PRICE IS RIGHT.  I LOVE IT.\n",
      "I LOVE this product.  I live in the Arizona desert and try everything I can to keep my skin moisturized, I've spent a lot of money on brand name creams, but this is the best cream I've ever used at night.  I put it on it's greaseless, orderless, light and the next morning I wake up and my skin is replenished and baby soft.  WHAT a value it is!  I am so happy I tried it.  If you have dry skin, I promise you this will make a difference.  Best product I've tried in a long time.\n",
      "this makes my skin so smooth\n",
      "Easily absorbed into skin and gives the face a fresh look.\n",
      "really feels great on your skin and makes it very smooth and soft....\n",
      "My absolute favorite facial lotion! Leaves my skin feeling so soft and fresh...love it!\n",
      "Perfect for everyday use!\n",
      "Excellent product. My skin feels so hydrated! I will buy again.\n",
      "Hydrates beautifully!\n",
      "I love this stuff. Keeps my face hydrated and smooth\n",
      "Excelente\n",
      "I have been using this every day since April. My skin looks and feels no different than when I was using Oil of Olay. I will go back to that, once this is gone.I am prone to very dry skin and thought this would help. I see no difference.\n",
      "This Neutrogena product caused my face to break out in hives, welts that were very sore and itchy!\n",
      "I absolutely love this product! A lot of the reviews have people complaining about a smell but I think the gel is pretty much odorless. Another big complaint is people saying the texture is to thick or too much like a gel. I think the gel part of the name is actually pretty misleading.  It does go on clear and it's not really a true lotion but it's not thick or heavy like you would think a gel would be. I have dry skin and this product delivers amazing moisture immediately and I've used this product for around 3 months now and I have zero complaints. I definitely recommend this product to anyone looking for a good moisturizer!\n",
      "I have very, very dry skin. I had high hopes for a moisturizing product bearing the Neutrogena name. I was sorely disappointed.  This cream did not alleviate my dry, tight feeling facial skin. It may be great for others with dry but not very dry skin but for me it did nothing. I do not blame anyone for  giving it a try after reading this because it is cheap enough but if money is not an issue try something else.\n",
      "I am on my third jar of this product.  I like it very much.\n",
      "Really, really hydrating product! Doesn't feel greasy and lasts all day! It has a texture similar to the clinique moisture surge. great price! I purchased for $15 and in stores it was $20+ love amazon!\n",
      "Just bought a second jar.  The first one lasted about 3 months.  The texture is great not slimey or shiny.  Absorbs quickly. Works great for my dry skin.  I used to use Clinique moisture surge and this is a very affordable substitute.  I think it works just as great for a fraction of the cost\n",
      "I had high hopes for this, but it's pretty average as far as gel moisturizers go. I apply tretinoin every night and this didn't really work for me. The next day my skin peels and flakes, no matter how much I slathered on. I finally ran through the pot, and I won't be repurchasing. On to the next brand...\n",
      "Nice lightweight, every day facial lotion that doesn't clog pores!\n",
      "a1\n",
      "Love this stuff. Too small amour for price. Pkg is deceiving.\n",
      "The first moisturizer that I've found makes a dramatic (and within a few days) difference. My skin gets very dry, especially in the winter and on my forehead, and this helps so much.\n",
      "This gel feels so good to put on, you can almost feel the extra water.  I do notice a small improvement in how my skin feels and looks, and no expensive cream does any better. It leaves your skin very soft.  And a tiny bit goes a long way. I will order this again when I run out.\n",
      "I was looking for a moisturizer that was very hydrating but was easier to spread than thick buttery creams. This is the perfect fit. It spreads almost like a watery gel, which means I can use way less. That way I save money and avoid over-applying and breaking out. I have EXTREMELY sensitive skin and almost every product I've tried (even the Simple brand all-natural moisturizer) can cause a burning sensation and lead to peeling and redness. This does not! It's super soothing and I even applied it to a bad sunburn on my shoulders and chest without any kind of reaction or pain.\n",
      "I've purchased and replenished the water gel lotion three times already. The commercial really sold me on the importance of hyaluronic acid and plumping aging skin.The bottle itself is really pretty with its effervescent blue, the fragrance is slightly strong but fragrant!I have combination acne prone skin, and this has not broken me out at all. The consistency is light and absorbs into skin fairly quickly, which is a must for my moisturizers.Cons : you have to dip your hand into the lotion so I usually end up with more than I need, hence needing to repurchase very often.I recently purchased the Neutrogena intensive retinol night cream so the hydro boost is my morning moisturizer. It definitely serves a better purpose as a morning moisturizer than a night cream.\n",
      "If you want soft, flawless skin you want this product. I am a loyal buyer of this moisturizer and it keeps me looking young.\n",
      "A very light and hydrating moisturizer.  I have very sensitive dry skin and most moisturizers either don't work or make me break out.  I have used other Neutrogena moisturizers in the past but they were discontinued and had switched to more expensive department store brands without noticing anything special.  I bought this product last year and was hooked.  It works beautifully and adds moisture to my face without being greasy or causing issues.\n",
      "I love this product.  it is light weight, not at all greasy, does not clog pores and is absorbed quickly.\n",
      "Haven't noticed any improvement in my skin however the cream goes in easily and drys almost instantly.\n",
      "Great moisture provided, excellent results in minutes. It doesn't feel greasy or heavy, just pure light hydrated feeling.\n",
      "I subtracted a star because of the packaging -- an unnecessary amount of NOT recyclable plastic. This is bad from an environmental point of view (shame on you Neutrogena!) and useless bulk when traveling. The gel cream itself is great. It's a good moisturizer and not in the least oily, so I image it would work well for any skin type. It is fragrance free.\n",
      "I spent the early part of my summer in search for a new moisturizer. My skin is a true normal/dry, I live in dry Arizona, and I have several medical issues requiring medication - so my skin can be a bit finicky (not sensitive). My problem with prior moisturizers is that they either didn't provide enough moisture so my skin would feel dry & tight after several hours or they were greasy, leaving an oily feeling film that never seemed to sink in. Dry skin needs moisture, not oil. Plus, when living in the HOT desert anything heavy just melts.I saw an ad for the Neutrogena Hydro Boost Gel Cream and honestly poo-pooed it. Yes, I was a skincare snob, avoiding \"drugstore\" brands. I was a fool. When in my local drugstore I happened to see this product on display. The sales associate provided tons of info and steered me to the \"gel cream\" over the \"gel\" (the one advertised). The price was so much better than what I was (foolishly) used to paying so I bought it on a whim. This is one of my best finds in several years!!The product is well packaged and easy to open. The product is a semi-transparent true gel-cream. I scoop out with a mini spatula, to avoid cross-contamination, and once on my fingertips softens to a bit more watery texture, but stayed on my fingers. It's easy to spread on my face, providing a nice cool feeling. It completely sinks in within minutes. After an hour my skin still feels nice, soft and hydrated. I have the same feeling after a few more hours. Ten to twelve hours later it's still awesome.This is a great product that does exactly what it says it's going to do. A great moisturizer for normal to dry skin (combo/oily should use the gel, not the gel-cream), especially in the warmer months.\n",
      "Love it\n",
      "Just got this, but so far I really like it. I have dry skin and it's very sensitive and prone to breaking out. This is moisturizing, absorbs quickly, and isn't oily. I really like it\n",
      "Despite some enthusiastic customer reviews, I don't feel this gel does much more than the usual creams I've been using. While it does feel cool and refreshing and quenching when applied, I feel I could use a cream which would give me deeper moisturizing even though its name says Boost and for Extra Dry skin. This is a good face gel for summer months when you come home from the beach and your skin feels parched but I don't feel it's as great as advertised. Won't buy again.\n",
      "This product does not hydrate the facial skin, definitely not for extra dry skin.  After I put on one layer, I can hardly feel that I have it on my face.\n",
      "Just what a dry face needs. Adds instant moisture! Feels cool when you apply which is nice after a warm shower!\n",
      "My dermatologist gave me many samples of moisturizers.  I LOVE this one.  Don't use anything else! Never greasy.\n",
      "I love this product! I have the extra dry skin version so it's really moisturizing!! There is no scent at all in the one I have, which would have been nice but that's ok. The gel cream itself is really silky and not sticky afterwards like I expected it to be. It dries very quickly, almost too quick sometimes so I have to put more on. The price though is a bit much, I paid $18.99 or something, because the container is mostly clear blue plastic asthetic packaging to make it look cool with a smaller tray of goop in it. Sometimes I do notice that it makes my skin a bit oily but I do tend to usually ave that problem by lunchtime anyway. Overall, I'll definitely buy it again! Maybe try the regular one since it is no longer winter. Great for day & night use. I wish they had one with an spf 15 sunblock in it so I didn't need another product on top of this & my ROC serum.\n",
      "I live this product. It's very light yet hydrating. I have even applied it over my makeup for a quick moisture boost after being in the sun all day. I love that it's a water gel. It does not leave me feeling greasy or oily either.\n",
      "Works very well. Leaves skin very soft and moisturized.\n",
      "good\n",
      "This product is great however I found out recently it is not cruelty free.\n",
      "So great for combination skin! Moisturizes dry spots and doesn't oversaturate oily spots. Doesn't cause breakouts or clog pores. No scent. Able to use AM or PM!\n",
      "This is the most amazing moisturizer I have ever used. I have an oily T-Zone, and have always had a hard time with moisturizers feeling greasy on my skin. This one is so light but so effective. A tiny little bit covers your entire face, and it feels like you have nothing on your face at all. You're left with your skin feeling soft and smooth. When I tell people that I'm going to turn 53, they never believe me. They say I look 35. Thank God for this product!\n",
      "When I first applied the product my skin felt great. The product is not greasy or heavy and it goes right into your skin. However, after a couple of hours my skin felt tight and dry. I have extremely dry skin all year around.\n",
      "Love this product! With the cold wintery winds my face has been a constant battle to keep moist and from getting dry and cracking.  Using this product helped to keep its natural moisture without getting too oily.\n",
      "LOVE LOVE LOVE IT!!!  Use it at night after a shower and let it soak it all night long. I have very dry skin and now the heat is on here in NH and in spite of a humidifier, its not enough without good skin cream. My complexion is very fair and during the day I use Neutrogena oil free with sunscreen, but this is my favorite of all time.  Extra dry feels cool when you put it on and skin feels soft as silk.  Great product!\n",
      "My skin is more dry than oily, and I also live in the deep-deep south. Skin stays perfectly hydrated all day, never feels greasy. I am so impressed. Will definitely buy forever!\n",
      "A positively fabulous product! I've purchased and thrown away so many moisturizers that I've lost count. This one is a keeper, in fact I am going to purchase another for my husband, who shaves his head. What I love about it is that it not only moisturizes, but goes on evenly and dries to a positively gorgeous finish that isn't sticky. I have super dry skin and a lot of products that I have used in the past hydrated my skin but felt like glue, sticky and untouchable. Their eye cream is equally as good!\n",
      "Very good moisturizer!\n",
      "Bought this to use under my makeup and I love it!!  It has an awesome feel and does keep my aging skin hydrated and makeup from sinking into my wrinkles....\n",
      "Makes my skin feel so soft. I have tried the gel and cream.  I like the gel because it dries quickly and does not make my skin feel greasy.  The cream is good if you have problems with dry skin.  No matter what I did this past winter, my face was so dry.  I used the cream and it added the moisture I needed. Nothing else worked. I use the cream when my face is really dry and the gel when my skin is normal to oily.\n",
      "This is the second time I brought this item. I really like it. It's fragrance free and super hydrate for my skin. I usually put on this before sleep and when I woke up my face feels so smooth and hydrate. It also can be used as primer before makeup to keep your skin soft and refresh.\n",
      "I usually like this product, but the one that came doesn't smell like the one in the drugstore, and doesn't have it's usual blue sheen. This is not the original product and has been switched with an inferior lotion.\n",
      "Love it\n",
      "Kinda goopy\n",
      "This is great ... I have SO many high end moisturizers & this one ranks right up there with them! Cooling when put on & awesome on my sensitive skin!  LOVE it!!!\n",
      "My new favorite lotion. No perfumes. Soaks in quickly. Leaves skin soft and smooth. A container lasts me about a month.\n",
      "I love this moisturizer! I have really dry skin and have struggled to find a regular moisturizer that I love. It made my skin feel supple and I couldn't wait to buy it again when I ran out while traveling. I'm planning to use it as a day-time moisturizer and separately apply SPF.\n",
      "My dermatologist recommended it, and I am very happy with the results.\n",
      "I tested Neutrogena Hydro Boost water gel for free from Influenster.  I am very happy with this product. I have dry skin in the Winter and this really takes care of it. I will definitetly be purchasing this again.\n",
      "Love this product. I don't have super dry skin, but I feel like this is gentle and plumps up my skin when I use it!\n",
      "I've almost used up the whole thing and already buying my second one! I use acne products that really dry my skin out and cause my skin to flake, but issuing this has helped keep my skin from being too dry just after one application. It's also a dream to use under your foundation! I heard that if you're using oil based foundation, you should use gel moisturizers so that you're not piling the same type of things on your skin which causes your makeup to never really settle. My foundation sits beautifully and I'm so glad I've found this product!! I'd say it's perfect to use all year round, but I live in Florida, so we don't really have seasons here 😂\n",
      "My husband loves this product.\n",
      "Live in a high wind and dry desert, my face recently started drying out so bad it had flakes all around.  I bought the Neutrogena Hydro Boost Gel-Cream and absolutely love it.  I put it on first thing in the morning and let it sink in, then my moisturizer and within 3 days my skin no longer as any dry flakes.Now I add the Neutrogena Sensitive Skin Sunscreen 60+ after and have great results.\n",
      "Love this.  Not greasy and cheaper than retail.\n",
      "Did not care for this product.  Just never sinks in, felt heavy on my face.\n",
      "Wonderful! I have combination skin so sometimes it’s very temperamental. I use a charcoal face wash that is slightly drying. This rehydrated my face very well. I use it right after I wash my face.\n",
      "Love this stuff. I mix it with sweet almond oil. It gives my face a natural glow.\n",
      "Works great On mature skin\n",
      "My go to moisturizer every night\n",
      "Great for hydrating skin and it's been working!!\n",
      "Does a really good job at keeping my skin hydrated. No longer have dry patches. Been looking for something that would go on light and dry quickly while also providing a barrier of hydration\n",
      "Ships quickly and makes my skin feel super soft. Kind of expensive for the amount inside, but I’d say it’s worth it.\n",
      "Feels like I'm giving my face a drink of water. No stickiness, just soft.\n",
      "GREAT CRAM LOVE IT TY AAAAA\n",
      "Item delivered as described, great value.\n",
      "Feels great on way face\n",
      "My skin feels hydrated after using this, and no breakouts happen :)\n",
      "Haven't seen any great improvement yet but will continue to use this product until it's finished.\n",
      "I recieved this product complimentary of influenster, and im so glad i got to try it out! It moisturizes my skin without feeling too heavy and feels very refreshing and cooling on the skin, comparable to clinique moisturizing gel!\n",
      "I'm a male with bad acne that has affected me by whole life. This is the only moisturizer I've used that doesn't cause me to break out. I've really been trying to clear up my face and this was the missing link. Without a good moisturizer your face tries to make up for the missing moisture with extra oil and that causes far more problems. I have combination skin and it works great and my fiance has dry skin and she likes it as well.I would recommend this product to anyone looking for a moisturizer.\n",
      "I love this product. Its super hydrating and moisturizing. I apply it every day.\n",
      "Saw no real difference in my skin. My cheaper skincare products work much better. Will pass this on to my teenage daughter.\n",
      "its not greasy at all and doesn't cause my face to breakout.\n",
      "Good value and works great. Much better than creams.We all noticed a difference right away!\n",
      "Awesome Great Product Great Shipping\n",
      "So far, so good.  I purchased this gel cream hoping it would be lighter for So Cal summers.  Lotions & creams were melting off in the warmth, but this gel is much better.  Goes on smoothly and absorbs quickly.\n",
      "I received this moisturizer for reviewing purposes from #Influenster - When they sent this to me I was excited as I suffer from dry skin. This has improved my face with the use of my Clarisonic as it leaves my skin clean and ready to soak up the product. This particular moisturizer I like because it has a watery light texture and after I apply it my face feels smooth . This moisturizer is perfect to use as a primer under the makeup as it feels the same as the expensive primer from S******X. This item I will continue to use as It's gentle for my sensitive skin and if something is harsh on my skin my broken capillaries will flare and gladly that doesn't happen with this one. I can totally recommend this to anyone with dry or sensitive skin!\n",
      "Love this moisturizer. I got a sample of it and had to buy a full jar. I have combination skin and have trouble finding lotion that doesn't make me skin greasy. This is great for moisturizing without the heavy feel. The only con is that it isn't heavy enough for my cheeks in the winter. In the winter I use this on my greasy forehead and a heavy moisturizer on my dry cheeks. In the summer though this is all I need for perfect moisturization. I feel like it helps with my skin tone too.\n",
      "One of the best moisturizers on the market. It's light and goes on smooth. Highly recommend.\n",
      "Excellent moisturizer for the face. Leave skin soft and non oily.\n",
      "The container is quite bulky for the amount of product, but I have enjoyed the gel-cream so much that I don't mind it. The cream rehydrates my dry skin without clogging my pores, and my skin has never looked better! I also enjoy that this cream is not oily!\n",
      "this product is great for my combination skin! its smells great. It doesnt leave a greasy feel because its not oil based it is water base. ive tried a few different brands of hyaluronic acid but none worked as well as this one. i highly recommend this brand of hyaluronic acid. i notice immediate softened skin and within a week or so i saw more bright supple skin.\n",
      "love it\n",
      "Seems to be doing the trick.  I haven't used it long.  I like the scentless cream.  I like the way it feels.  I don't know what will happen later but I like it. There is no yucky feel.  It is just a delightful cream.  Very light.\n",
      "Absolutely amazing! This stuff changed my face completely. I had horrible, dry skin from veltin that looked like chemical burns on the side of my face but this stuff fixed it within a week! Love it!\n",
      "This stuff is so amazing!! It absorbs so well into my skin and feels almost cooling and plumping. I had extremely dry irritated skin a couple weeks ago, and this has made the biggest difference. It's just makes my skin feel so soft!! Love\n",
      "This product is great.  I definitely feel like my skin looks more \"plumped\" up during the day.  Not so tired and dry.  I put it on all the time.  It never has caused any irritation.  I have already bought a second bottle and the eye gel.  Definitely a product that is a keeper in my skn car regime.\n",
      "really hydrating\n",
      "Great product that works as advertised!!!\n",
      "Recommended by my sister-in-law who works for a dermatologist and this is what he recommends.  So far, my skin feels smooth and the lines are fading.\n",
      "This moisturizer is amazing! It sinks in quickly and doesn't seem to sit on my skin. It dries to a matte finish, practically doubles as a makeup primer, and doesn't break me out. This moisturizer also goes pretty far in mitigating the oil production on my skin--it doesn't stop it entirely, but it does help quite a bit. My only complaint is that I wish they sold it in a bigger size.\n",
      "Irritated my skin, didn't moisturize just left a shiny film on my face. I stopped using it and my breakout consisting of painful cyst pimples is slowly going away.\n",
      "Love this\n",
      "Amazing product! I have never purchased it off Amazon but am going to start as it's almost $5 cheaper than the drugstores in NYC. I have been using this for about 15 months. After I shared my disappointment with other moisturizers, the gel cream was recommended to me by my dermatologist to go along with a new skincare regimen that included prescription products. I've struggled with large pores, very stubborn blackheads and the occasional zit that just won't go away for years. Also, greesy skin with dry patches. I was able to find a product that greatly helped with those issues, but after using it for close to 10 years, I felt I had hit a platau. Being in my late 20s, I also had some concerns about wrinkle and aging prevention.After using this, my skin has never looked better!!I have tried the water gel and eye serum and returned both. However, the gel cream is awesome. I will admit that at first I did have some discomfort with the product, but this is also related to my skin adjusting. I began using the gel cream at the same time I started Retin-A and Differin gel. So yes, between starting all three I experienced some burning and needed to fan my face a good 15 mintues. At times I wanted to give up but after about 2 weeks of burning and awful peeling my skin looked amazing. Friends immediately noticed a difference. Hasn't made me break out, keeps my skin soft and clear. For the first few days I was amazed at how soft my face was! Literally drank this stuff up with my pores. I can't tell if it's done anything for wrinkles yet.I used a generous amount and my skin soaked up a lot of product for the better part of year. I was going through 1 pot a month (using both morning and night). Over time and in conjunction with the serum 1 pot now lasts about 2 months. I love this stuff and use it after I wash my face, always!This is my current morning and night routine. I can't say my skin is perfect but I couldn't be happier with the results I've had so far. I'm sharing it here for anyone who is having similar issues, especially large, clogged pores causing deep blackheads, and greasey yet also dry skin.Morning:-Wash with prescription sulfer wash or gentle cleanser (in rotation, usually a few days for each). **Sulfer can be kind of harsh for some, but its seriously amazing at clearing out pores! Grandpa's Thylox Soap is the best OTC I've found, whigh means it does not need a prescription! It can be used on the face and any other area that breaks out, like back or chest. I used this for long time and still keep it around to use as sometimes the Rx stuff is too strong. You will see and feel results after 1 use. Sulfer is amazing. Rx can comes as a \"kit\" with a basic moisturizering face wash for this purpose.-Neutrogena Hydroboost serum (about 3 pumps)-Neutrogena Hydroboost water gel-Rite Aid Renewal Ultimate Sheer SPF 70 (or maybe not, depending on my plans for the day)-Simple Sensitive Skin Experts SPF 15 daily moisturizer (not sure how much I like is product but, it's not terrible)Night:-Wash with prescription sulfer wash or gentle cleanser-Retin-A micro (every other night or less)-Differin gel-Neutrogena Hydroboost serum (about 3 pumps)-Neutrogena Hydroboost water gel-Neutrogena Light Night CreamI hope this helped, not everything is going to work for everyone but definitely give this product a shot, it's worth it!\n",
      "Great! Feels so nice on the skin! I have very dry skin so this has been perfect for me!\n",
      "I love this product. No annoying  ingredients that wil  irritate your skin . This leaves my skin super refreshed and hydrated. Fresh aquatic scent that’s  non-irratating. Love this stuff.\n",
      "Excellent product.  Very hydrating.  Can see results immediately.\n",
      "Nice stuff. Feels refreshing on my face.  My skin isn't particularly dry but I'd tried a sample in dermatologist office and liked. I don't think I would recommend for really dry skin.  Good for normal-somewhat dry, mature skin. Not sure if I'll purchase again.\n",
      "I have dry and very sensitive skin. I have psoriasis and use Neutrogena body wash, body oil, and powder makeup and have had no problems. But this product made my face break out even though it was fragrance free. I did like the gel though it was soothing. But I think I will get the sensitive skin moisturizer I have used in the past which didn't cause me to break out.\n",
      "When I read the word\"acid\" in the ingredients, I decided against it.\n",
      "I've tried every cream known to man, from pharmacy stuff to high end dept store stuff to ordering diecrtly from London and France and thought what the heck, what's one more? Lol. Well so far, this is terrific!! After only a week there's a very very noticeable deference in the texture of my skin. I'm using it on my neck and chest too. And I have the specific eye cream too. It's really great--I highly recommend it!\n",
      "nothing special t works ok.  i just expected more\n",
      "I love this product. I noticed results right away! I was afraid it would make my skin break out but it did not.\n",
      "Works fine on normal skin, dry skin will probably need something richer.\n",
      "I have combination dry/ oily skin. It's hard to find a product that won't make me feel completely greasy, but still hydrate my skin.I got two samples of this through a beauty box:the original and for extra-dry skin. For me personally, the extra-dry skin worked way better than the original, which is why I ended up buying the full size. This one nourishes your skin more and you don't have to worry about looking shiny. It absorbs into your skin quickly and leaves it soft.While it may seem expensive for being less than two ounces, a little goes a long way. I don't need to put a lot on my face to make my dry patches go away.\n",
      "My teen uses it because it isn’t greasy and helps offset the dryness some Sulphur and benzoyl peroxide products cause. No smell to speak of. Use with retin-a also.\n",
      "Incredible product. In the past 30+ years, I've used dozens of 'reasonably priced' topical products for daily and nighttime application to the area directly under and corners of my eyes. I've used this Gel-Cream for less than a week and am blown-away by how fantastic it feels immediately after applying and the positive visible results!! Using my finger, I swipe a thin layer and let it sit on top of the skin. Within a few minutes it is absorbed and leaves the area amazingly smooth without any eye or skin irritation. I do not write many product reviews, this is one that I'm happy to share, $17 VERY WELL SPENT!!\n",
      "I love this stuff! Different from other moisturizers I've tried recently in that its not greasy at all, doesn't make my skin red or burn at all. Just very light and soothing and makes my super dry skin look glowy and healthy.  I noticed for the first time that I didn't even really need to wear foundation. Love it!\n",
      "I like the texture of this gel cream, but though it says it's for extra dry skin it certainly does not effectively moisturize my moderately dry skin when faced with a Midwestern winter. I probably won't ever repurchase, but if I did it would only be for summertime use.\n",
      "Great product for older skin.\n",
      "I do not usually do reviews but I felt that I should on this one..... I am not someone who typically has sensitive skin, but this broke me out really bad. I woke up with pimpled all over my chin, jaw line, and a few on my neck. I had more pimples this morning than I ever had even at the height of puberty. I am sending this back and sticking to my philosophy renewed hope in a jar dry. It costs more but it is def worth it. I don't know if this was just me but this stuff destroyed my skin. BEWARE!\n",
      "This product is not a dupe for The True Cream Aqua Bomb by Belief. This Neutrogena product broke me out terribly.\n",
      "*♡*\n",
      "I received this product free for testing from Influencer.I'm a little lazy about skin care... When I received Hydro Boost, I was a little ways into my twin pregnancy, and my face was a mess. I'd been thinking I needed to figure out some low maintenance way of doing SOMETHING to get that \"pregnancy glow\" I had been promised. This gel clearly didn't banish my acne, but it did make my skin feel super soft and smooth - after the first use! I love that I don't feel greasy after putting it on, and can put makeup on shortly after applying. Regular lotions don't absorb quickly enough for me! This stuff is delightful, and reasonably-priced enough that it seems worth it to buy another tub when this one is gone. Which should be a while, as a little bit goes a long way!\n",
      "Love how light weight it feels\n",
      "I have moderate eczema, so I get occasional flare-ups in random places and wherever they happen my skin gets SUPER dry, flaky, itchy, tight, scaly, and just generally uncomfortable. It gets to the point where I don't feel comfortable even being in my own skin at home and often dread when I have to shower because it stings. I purchased this for when I happened to get a flare up on my face... it was over the front side of my neck and all over the sides of my cheeks and forehead. I felt that my typical eczema body lotions might be too heavy to use on my face, so I got this lotion in hopes that it would be just thick enough to keep my face hydrated but not so thick that I'd have an oily/slick sheen of balm all over my face when I have to venture out into the world.SOOO When I got this I was hoping it would give me all-day skin hydration.... but it didn't. It would feel nice on my skin for maybe the first hour or so, and then I'd go back to feeling the same as if I hadn't applied it at all.For flare-ups, drier than usual skin, or even people that have a hint of some kind of skin disorder that requires some intense skin moisturizing - I would NOT recommend this product. It is far too thin/watery to give your skin all-day or even half-day moisture.For people that have slightly drier than normal skin or just dry skin without any kind of skin disorder accomplish the dryness - perhaps this will suit you better than the heavier duty products.\n",
      "I love this gel cream.  I have rosacea and it's hard to find products that provide good moisturization without irritating my skin.  This does the trick.  But make sure you get the \"extra dry skin\" version if you have sensitive skin - the regular version made my rosacea flare.\n",
      "I'm on my second tub of this moisturizer & I love it.  I have rosacea and have been using Neutrogena Light Night Cream for years & was happy with it.  A couple months ago my skin was horribly flared up & I decided to try changing up my products to see if I could find a better combination.  I changed my face wash to Cerave Hydrating Cleanser & my lotion to this Hydro Boost Gel-Cream Extra-Dry.  After about a week, my skin was sooo much better.  It feels so much better & the redness has decreased dramatically.  This lotion feels so nice on my skin & is so gentle that I can use it over my eyes as well--no need for a separate eye cream.  I use it at night after I wash my face & in the morning after I shower.  I have had no problems putting my makeup on over it.  I love that this is not scented.  It seems to be absorbed right away & doesn't leave me feeling greasy (although my skin is more likely to look dry & flaky than greasy).  It has also taken care of the flaky skin on my cheeks.  I haven't had any problems with breakouts using this.\n",
      "Nice and creamy for dry skin\n",
      "I LOVE this cream.  I live in Arizona where it is VERY dry.  This moisturizer is perfect for my very dry skin.  It goes on smoothly and my skin looks much better since I have been using it.  I have it set up on an automatic delivery.  You won't be sorry.\n",
      "like this but proablt would not buy it again\n",
      "Good product. Nice moisturizer.\n",
      "I have been using this product for over 30 years. No one ever guesses my age, as I look 25-30 years younger than I am. Good genes probably pay a part, but as a photographic model in my younger years I learned the value of making-down for a natural look and Neutrogena has been a mainstay in my daily regimen. Now living in the desert SW, it is even more valuable.\n",
      "Excellent\n",
      "This product is excellent...this ia the scent free formula and it is exactly that.  It is a very rich cream which plumps and smooths.  I would say it compares to Clinique, which I also love, but this costs much less.\n",
      "Very moisturizing. But after using this, the foundation that I apply will looks very mat and dry, made the winkles more appeal. But without foundation, this is a good product to use.\n",
      "Good cream, peels off sometimes, my skin doesn't absorb it completely\n",
      "I have tried many creams over the years. I am 70 now ... It is the BEST ... also, if you have some \"crepey\" skin it gets rid of ittemporarily.  The moisture just absorbs into the skin quickly.\n",
      "as advertised, timely delivery, good product.\n",
      "This hydrates my skin very well and isn't irritating as I have dermatitis and must be very careful of products I use. It sinks into the skin providing great hydration. However, if your looking for it to address anti ageing you will need to use something else on top of this. It's a very good moisturizer but since I need to use something else to address anti ageing I'm giving 4 stars.\n",
      "I have really dry/sensitive skin and I absolutely love this moisturizer. It seriously makes my skin feel so plump and hydrated. I wish there was a jar that was like 3 times this size because I seem to go through it so quickly!\n",
      "Not good for sensitive skin. My skin was irritated and itched the second I put it on.\n",
      "Best moisturizer for my allergy prone skin.\n",
      "Great moisturizer.  Goes on smooth & absorbs quickly.  Love it.\n",
      "Skin feels great afterwards. Only issue is it doesn't have sunscreen so I can only use it in the evenings or when I'm not going out. Works great during the colder months.\n",
      "This is an amazing product. After a few weeks, my skin was looking better than ever. The formulation is good for your skin and it is perfect for sensitive/dry skin.\n",
      "I received my product today and to my surprise the box for the product has been opened. The box around the product has been crushed and I feel like the product inside has been tampered.\n",
      "One of the best moisturizers I even tried. Really is dermatologist recommended.I showed it to my dermatologist he said they really like this product & they highly recommend it!!!\n",
      "I have dry skin and am very pleased with this . Will def buy again!!\n",
      "Love love LOVE this lotion. Works perfect and doesn’t leave skin feeling oily.\n",
      "Good product\n",
      "I am in LOVE with this stuff. A very small amount will cover your face so you won't be buying this constantly. I have pale skin and this has done wonders for evening out my skin tone and not making me look blotchy or dry.\n",
      "This might be good for people who don't have terribly dry skin, but for people with patchy dry skin, avoid this. I have dry skin year round, but in the fall and winter is gets exceptionally bad. I get red, scaly patches and white flakes all over. I got desperate and tried this thinking a pricier item might do the trick, but this was by far the worst product I tried. It actually burned my dry skin and turned it bright red.I did give it 2 stars because it made my hands feel awesome and they don't have a dry skin problem. So I guess just avoid it if you have exceptionally dry skin.\n",
      "I was hoping this would be a dupe for Peter Thomas Roth Cloud Cream, but it’s actually more like Belif Aqua Bomb. Still good, but not my first choice. It’s fairly light and moisturizing, but doesn’t have the same silky finish that the PTR Cloud Cream provides.\n",
      "Excellent moisturizing with a very light feel.\n",
      "This started as a good moisturizer, but shortly after using this about a week in my dry skin came back.This did not work for me.\n",
      "Nice cream\n",
      "It is more of a gel than a cream and absolutely perfect to make your skin feel like velvet.  I use it every night and my skin is so plump and delicious in the morning.  I REALLY love it in the summer when you don't want to put anything heavy on your face.  It contains hyaluronic acid, which is something that makes your skin hold more moisture--especially on older, drier skin.  You WILL NOT regret purchasing this heavenly product!\n",
      "Noticeable results in one day! For weeks I have had rough, dry patches on my face with bumps resembling acne, most likely due to the harsh New England weather. My skin was uncomfortably dry and seemed to be getting worse by the day. I was in desperate need of a rescue, and my usual moisturizing oils were not doing the trick. After seeing reviews on this product, I decided to give it a try. 24 hours later and my face truly feels on the road to recovery. The dry, red bumpy patches are noticeably less inflamed and are about 95% smooth. The product feels great going on my face. I can't wait to see what results I will have after long term use, but was so impressed with the 24 hour turn around that I felt compelled to review.  Highly recommend!\n",
      "Wonderful!\n",
      "was not moisturizing enough for me,\n",
      "I normally buy this from the drugstore, but decided to order on Amazon this time. It seems like the same product, but smells really old. Not worth saving a couple dollars... I’ll stick to buying it from the drugstore rom now on.\n",
      "I love this product! It is an essential part of my skin care routine.\n",
      "Best product ever!\n",
      "SMALL QUANTITY. IT WAS GONE IN WEEKS FROM NORMAL USE, NOT ENOUGH IN THE CONTAINER TO MAKE IT WORTH IT'S WHILE.\n",
      "I really like how the hydro boost helps diminish the appearance of fine lines and helps keep my dry skin stay hydrated.\n",
      "Living in the desert, I’m a patsy for new moisturizers.  I’ve used just about every one available and have settled on Eucerin Smoothing Repair for body and have used Olay Micro sculpting as my facial moisturizer for years.  I’ve been extremely happy with the Olay product but when I saw a TV ad for this Neutrogena product, I wanted to try it.  Very clever packaging- the blue color and ads with lots of water make you think “moisture, moisture, moisture” :)  So, patsy that I am, I picked up a jar the next day at a big box store.What a disappointment.  This is a fairly light cream and can’t say my skin felt particularly moisturized even immediately after first use.  And the next morning my face didn’t feel soft and moisturized at all.  I shrugged it off and set the jar aside accepting it as a lesson learned.  But a few days later I ran out my usual Olay and ended up using this for the next couple of days.  By day three I looked awful.  My skin seemed dry and tired, not soft and plump.  So I made a special trip to the store for Olay which will last until my next subscribe and save delivery from Amazon :)The main selling point here seems to be the fact that it contains hyaluronic acid.  That is a good ingredient since studies show that applied topically it may help replace the hyaluronic acid your skin loses over time and, like glycerin, it does act as a humectant, pulling moisture from the air.  But many skin care products use it (including Olay) and since it is 16th of 19 listed ingredients (11th in Olay) I don’t know that there is enough here to be effective.  If HA is your main concern, I would just get a bottle of readily available pure HA serum.So while I admire the clever marketing, I can’t say that I’m impressed with the actual product.\n",
      "Works well and feels cooling and calming\n",
      "excellent product, love it, thank you\n",
      "Love this moisturizer\n",
      "I've been using this gel-cream on my face for awhile now, since winter started. Before this, my forehead felt like it was cracking from the furnace running. Not so since I've used this, my face no longer feels tight nor does it flake. I also use the eye gel-cream and I actually prefer using this FACE cream around my eyes.It's also good for eczema. I have a small 2\" diameter of it on my leg right above my ankle and it's very soothing for the itching.\n",
      "I liked it, but for my age, need anti-aging cream\n",
      "Really wanted to love this, and honestly it DID feel nice on my skin, but it felt like I needed to use a pretty large amount to fully hydrate my skin and the container is TINY. It ran out in no time. If it were a larger container for the same price I might keep using it, but as it stands I think I'd have to repurchase every few weeks! Not great for a moisturizer supposedly targeted at people with dry skin...\n",
      "It didn't really work for me. Plus, it's a little messy.\n",
      "I have to say I am not happy with this product. I feel like for the money I paid, it's so not worth it. I have been using Ponds Dry Skin Cream for many years and have never decided to try anything else because Ponds works on my dry skin and it doesn't clog my pores. I should of known better. If it it's not broke don't fix it ladies!! The ingredients are totally different compared to my regular Ponds. I have really dry skin that thirsts for moisture after every shower and face washing. My regular face cream is oil based. This Neutrogena Hydro Boost is not. For that simple fact, it does not hydrate my skin to the level that I need. I put it on and fifteen minutes later my skin feels dry again. There are many questionable ingredients in this Hydro Boost. My regular Ponds face cream is not natural by any means but this Hydro Boost has almost half as many ingredients and questionable ones... (synthetic beeswax? blue dye?)  The packaging is pretty. It looks like it will work. For some women it may work just fine. I suffered from acne and extremely dry skin as a teenager. I have since found an oil based moisturizer that works and I made the mistake of buying this thinking that this fancy looking product would be incredibly hydrating and the hydraulic acid would help prevent wrinkles. I have stopped using this and went back to my regular. much better, much cheaper. actually hydrating.\n",
      "Affordable and perfect for my oil skin at winter.\n",
      "excellent!\n",
      "I've been using Neutrogena's Hydro Boost Gel Cream, Extra Dry for almost 2 weeks now and truthfully can say it has made a difference in my skin.  I noticed in less than a week that the small lines around my mouth have softened and grown less noticeable.  I have been using it once a day, at night but also use it as a sort of primer before putting on makeup as I had read some other reviewers suggested.  I like it!  It will be interesting to see if the results get even better over time or if simply making your existing lines less obvious is the extent of its powers.  It is interesting, because most of the other products I use tend to be mostly natural, which I like.  Of course, a lot of these ingredients sound synthetic, but they actually are natural.  Here's an example: Cetearyl olivate and Sorbitan olivate.  Turns out these are PEG-free moisturizers emulsifiers made from Olive oil.  On the other hand, you have Polyacrylamide, a water soluble acrylic resin; that's probably what makes this a gel.  Anyway, I do like Neutrogena products as a rule and this one has already improved the appearance of my skin, so I will keep using it and see what happens.  I thought the price (on Amazon, not in stores) was fair, but I do wish the jar was a little bigger (thus the 4 stars).  The Extra Dry version has no perfumes or colors added.\n",
      "Not that moisturizing enough for my 55 year old face.\n",
      "I bought the gel and it worked great, but because I have mature skin I used to put moisturizer on top of it. So I decided to try the gel-cream for extra dry skin and was told by neutrogena that they had to change one of the ingredients and it will be just as effective as the original.  When I used the cream it made my skin peel, I had to stop using it. I was so disappointed because my first purchase I actually saw an immediate difference in my skin's moisture level. Neutrogena go back to the old ingredients!\n",
      "Good for soft skin\n",
      "Feels so silky on my skin!\n",
      "This has been one of my favorite lotions. It is thick but not overly thick and it does not make me break out! A little goes a long way so it has lasted awhile.\n",
      "I like to wear this unDer my makeup.  My skin feels good and my makeup seems to stay intact longer.\n",
      "I've started using this as my new moisturizer paired with a hyaluronic acid foam cleanser and my skin has never felt more smooth and hydrated!I have SUPER oily skin and I have noticed a slight difference in my oil production since incorporating this into my routine.\n",
      "Such a great product, I feel it is overpriced for neutrogena. If it were a little cheaper it would be my ride ir die.\n",
      "I have the world's driest skin, I swear. This is the best moisturizer I have ever used! My skin is hydrated and radiant, and even my makeup looks better on top of it. You get a decent amount of product, but the container is shallower than you think, and is white on the inside, so it's difficult to tell if you're running low or not.\n",
      "This is a great moisturizer, my skin is sensitive and dry.  This has worked great for me and keeps my skin soft and moisturized.\n",
      "ABSOLUTE BEST STUFF EVER! I am on Accutane (look it up if you don't know what it is) and my skin is extremely dry from Accutane, but this gel cream cures the dry levels.\n",
      "This product advertises hylauronic acid as its star ingredient yet it's way down on the list of ingredients. What actually is making your skin feel \"softer\" is the 3 or 4 kinds of dimethicone they put in this product. It is a cheap and common ingredient that gives temporary effects. Neutrogena uses it in a lot of products. Many are sensitive to this ingredient and it can easily clog pores in the large amounts seen here as it forms a layer on top of the skin. I think this product is an attempt to dupe the gel texture creams that have been popular in Korean skin care. Sort of a gimmick\n",
      "excellent product\n",
      "Honestly the best moisturizer I've ever used. It doesn't feel oily at all and my dry skin feels so soft after use. It also doesn't have a smell which is great. It also feels super cooling. I just purchased my third one recently!\n",
      "feels really nice on skin.It is absorbed into the skin.\n",
      "Daughter loves this - she’s prone to acne and this doesn’t break her face out and keeps it moisturizes just right. Good price too!\n",
      "It lasted 3 months and a half. I was using it in alm my face, including eye area. I liked it, it did not break me out. I bought the extra dey one because its fragance free. Even though my face is oily. I liked it. But you should know, this is a humectant not a moisturizer. You need to seal it with something on top. But definitely my skin face improved after!  Right now im trsting the hada labo hialluronic acid.. its the same as this one, different brand. Let’s see if i go back to neutrogena.\n",
      "Really light weight. I have sensitive skin and it's breaking me out a little. Not sure if it's the product, change in skincare, or hormones so I'll be testing it out for a few weeks and see how it is.\n",
      "I used to spend a fortune at the makeup counter in high end moisture boost products. Now I’m using Neutrogena hydro boost. It’s hydrating but not heavy. Just enough to activate my moisturizer. As always, Neutrogena is a great product.\n",
      "Good product ,but does not hydrate my skin all day.\n",
      "I enjoy the formula of this moisturizer. Since it is in the gel format, it sinks into the skin quickly and does not feel greasy or sticky.However, this formula would not be suited for people with severely dry skin. It is not moisturizing enough. Also, I wish that they would change the packaging. I do not like tub containers, because it's very difficult to keep bacteria out of the products.\n",
      "It works OK. Nothing special about it\n",
      "Excellent product.\n",
      "I have extremely dry skin on my forehead and at first this seemed to be working wonderfully but then my skin became very dry and flaky again. Found another product that worked much better.\n",
      "My son is taking acne medication that dries his skin badly. He says that this provides instant relief.\n",
      "I have really dry skin and lotions and creams don't work for me, they clog my pores and it just feels gross. My cousin let me try some of her Clinique Moisture Surge gel cream and I really liked, so searched for more affordable alternatives. I came across this one and decided to try it out, it was $16 which is cheaper than Target, $20. It's not as good as the Clinique but I think it's pretty close, there are 1.7 oz per jar for both, the Neutrogena would be about $9.50/oz (@ $16) and the Clinique is about $23/oz (@ $39).\n",
      "A tiny amount goes a long way. I was looking for a gel cream for awhile now and was so happy with this. I have tried other facial moisturizers and they all felt so heavy and thick. It was hard to put make up on after and it felt like cake. There is little to no scent. Even with no scent it does not smell like weird lab stuff, if you get what mean. I also have been using it for dry skin on my legs after close shaves.\n",
      "I started with the gel (looks clear blue like jello) from Costco, and then bought this one thought it was the same, but this one is actually white-ish. So it's a bit more thick than the gel. I didn't realize the difference when I bought it but I actually LOVE it! Especially for the colder months it's perfect.I have very very dry skin.\n",
      "I absolutely love this face lotion. I wish that is wasn't so expensive, but I buy it anyway. A few weeks ago, I used a glycolic acid treatment on my face and inadvertently burned my chin. After doing some research, I discovered that lotions that are high in hyaluronic acid are best for helping burns heal. I used it every 30 minutes for a day or two and I've been using it on my face daily ever since. It's good stuff.\n",
      "ultra hydrating made my skin so soft\n",
      "Love this cream. Moist and absorbs well\n",
      "nice for summer not greacy at all over all ok\n",
      "Neutrogena products do a very good job for a reasonable price.  Each of their products has been well received at our home and we would purchase again.  This product skins in well on the face and before long, I am ready for my blusher.  No complaints.\n",
      "Love this lotion. It feels so good on my skin. I've been having some dry skin lately and I have tried several different products without success. This arrived on time with no damage.  I will be buying again.\n",
      "ok\n",
      "Feels great, especially after the sun.\n",
      "Disappointed , my face appears dryer with this.  I have mature comination skin and was excited to try this but my face looks dry and dehydrated when using this moisturizer.  Maybe would work better for someone with oily skin.\n",
      "This is the best all-day non-greasy moisturizer. Great for men- not sticky or wet. Excellent absorption without excessive shine.\n",
      "I sell luxury skincare and admittedly spend thousands per year on the top of the line cremes and serums. This moisturizer is just as good in terms of quality and results. Perfect for day- fast absorbing and works well with makeup!\n",
      "So first off, I'm a dude. I use no lotions or fancy soaps. Recently turned 31 and started to have dry skin and facial blemishes. I tried soaping more but that lead to even more dry skin. Finally I turned to Amazon and looked up face cream and was led to this. AMAZING!This gel dries w/o leaving any oily residue or ANY residue of any kind. Instead my face seems to soak up this stuff and feels super hydrated!If you have dry face issues, get this now.\n",
      "I have alway's  wanted to try this but it was out of my price range and now it's very good for my skin which is dry.Today is March the7th and someone asked a question so  here so this is the answer this product is for extra dry skin only and works very well love  it and I will order more of this as long as the price does not go up to high cause I'm almost out.\n",
      "I love this stuff.  Goes on very smooth and you only need a little dab here and there.  I have Rosacea and it does not irritate my face which is a big plus.  I've only been using it a couple of weeks so I can't judge on whether my skin has been improved.  I will update in a couple of months.\n",
      "I just love this product!  I suffer from very dry skin during the winter, especially on my face.  Not to sound tacky, but this gel quenches the thirst of my skin!  It's thick but goes on soft and smooth without feeling heavy at all.  I highly recommend it.\n",
      "I purchased the 1.7 oz, of Extra-Dry Skin gel-cream. I honestly was seriously skeptical about buying this. For the first time ever, the skin on my face just absolutely dried up. It was seriously dry and at the time I feared it was psoriasis. I originally was using just some random lotion (body lotion to be exact), and then I bought some off brand cetaphil. That only put a layer on my face that went away quickly. As a college student that lacks money, I was really skeptical because I didn't want to buy crap that was $14 and have it not work, but my skin got so bad that I would try anything. The box and everything came in tact. At first I tried it, it did burn. I can't contribute it to the ingredients in the bottle because previously I had basically just stripped my skin of everything that almost anything put on my face, even if it was meant to be soothing, burned. I continued with putting it on my face when I felt it was extremely dry, so usually mornings when I wake up, right after classes (which is usually around 3-4 hours later, and then right after my shower (since I exfoliate). Now it is not completely \"long lasting\". I do have to reapply a few times a day, but in the long run, I have noticed that my skin has become a lot more moist and \"plump\" compared to what it was before. Before I rubbed my face and it sounded like sandpaper and felt even worse. Now my skin feels amazing, my face no longer burns when I apply this stuff, and overall it really does give a cool refreshing feeling. There really is no smell to it, unless you are super super sensitive to smells and directly sniffed the cream then I guess you could say it is \"chemically\", and by chemically I just mean like nothing has been added. They just add the ingredients and nothing else. You may smell something every time you open the bottle, maybe if your face is close enough, but once you apply it to your skin I noticed the smell vanishes quite quickly. I read a lot of the reviews and I took a chance and I am extremely happy with this product. Even when my skin goes back to normal, I plan on using this stuff. For me this stuff worked like a miracle. Once applied definitely gives you a smoother feel to the face, but don't expect immediate results. It does go away and that dry skin will come back, but much like an ointment or medicine, you just have to keep applying it when you feel necessary. In no way shape or form am I being paid to write a good review. I just found this stuff as a new college student in a slightly new environment (same state, just different city), with skin problems, to be an amazing solution that is worth the \"splurge\".\n",
      "I Love it. I am a Male and this makes my thick skin feel soft and youthful. This cream is not greasy. It has a very light scent but it is a pleasant scent. This cream is soothing and I surely will buy again. Awesome cream!\n",
      "Good for very dry skin\n",
      "Not the best for dry skin\n",
      "This product enhanced the oil on my face:(\n",
      "perfect\n",
      "So far this is the only moisturizer that I absolutely LOVE and believe me, I have tried them all. This adds just the right amount of moisture to my dry skin without ever making my face look greasy. I never break out and have noticed a definite decrease in my wrinkles.\n",
      "Best moisturizer. It's oil free, so it does not clog pores. Keeps my dry skin hydrated. Have repurchased over and over again.\n",
      "I have dry skin. This is my holy grail PM moisturizer and lip mask. I'll use it during the day if my face is extra dry, too. Will continue to buy forever\n",
      "Only been using this for 2 days and I can already tell a noticiable difference with the dryness of my skin. Will definitely continue to use.\n",
      "love this item... no more dry skin for me :)\n",
      "of no use\n",
      "A GIFT; LOVE IT\n",
      "Really great moisturizer.\n",
      "I LOVE THIS. I use it every night for my dry skin and the next morning I can't stop feeling how soft I get.\n",
      "Love this stuff. Oil free moisture!\n",
      "I love using this , my face remains so hydrates without the oily look and feel.\n",
      "I love this stuff. It goes on really easily and is nongreasy. It does wonders with the dryness I get from using Retin A. It makes my skin feel smooth and \"plumped.\"\n",
      "Does what it is supposed to do\n",
      "I'm using and loving it. It does not dry the skin, does not burn and is not oily. Moisturizes the skin and 3 days in use to tell the difference. I'm really enjoying it!!!\n",
      "May work for some but not me... Caused a face break out and really clogged pores.\n",
      "My skin feels like it just drank water after every use. Love it!\n",
      "Very moisturizing.\n",
      "One of the more effective lower cost moisturizers.\n",
      "I ordered this because it was unscented and it still caused my skin irritation. But I have very sensitive skin. Other than that it was very moisturizing.\n",
      "Feels so great on my skin.\n",
      "I love this stuff. It’s very moisturizing, smells nice, and has a refreshing feeling.\n",
      "Works great!!\n",
      "arrived broken and leaking inside the box\n",
      "Oh I really love this moisterzer I'am post menopausal 59 and I have no oil left on my face anymore and this quenchs my skin and makes my face feel moist and soft all day. Thank You\n",
      "Really moisturizing\n",
      "Makes my face feel hydrated and soft.\n",
      "It's great at what it says it does!I'm not looking for a miracle cream. I prefer products that are very good at what they do.This neutrogena cream is lightweight and feels moisturizing, and I use it as a final layer after my skincare routine in the evenings. It is light and gel-like so it absorbs easily. It also leaves me face just a bit tacky feeling.I prefer the extra dry skin version because it contains hyaluronic acid while the other version doesn't, as far as I know. Hyaluronic acid is great for people with oily skin as well. Even if you're an oily skin type, your skin could be dehydrated and hyaluronic acid will help because it absorbs moisture. It can hold 1000x its weight in water!Some cons are that the actual amount of hyaluronic acid (one of the things this product brags about) is fairly low and is almost at the end of the ingredients list. It also has dimethicone as the second ingredient, so those who break out from silicones should be wary. The dimethicone helps it do its job as an occulusive layer though. It's not as heavy as other creams, but where I live, I don't have a need for heavy creams. This is a great final layer for skincare in the daytime or nighttime if you don't find yourself needing a richer moisturizer.I've tried it directly under makeup, and it just doesnt work for my skin. My foundation separates and I look rather greasy by 4 hours...and I am not an oily person. I have very dry skin so that was interesting. I've tried it also under a primer and then foundation, but it doesn't work either. However, that's just my personal experience. My friend who also uses this swears by it. It does leave your face a bit tacky and does have a large amount of silicone so I do believe it can work as a primer for some people.However, this isn't a deal breaker. This is my second repurchase and I'm happy that it does what it states to do well.Tip: I also like to incorporate oils into my nighttime routine. The oils I use absorb so much faster into my skin when I add a few drops to this moisturizer and then pat it in gently. :)\n",
      "Simply the best treatment for dry skin available at any  price. Buy the hydo boost wash as well and get the travel tube too.\n",
      "Love it\n",
      "This product is absolutely amazing! Must have for any face type! Great to put on after cleansing your face in the morning or night. Adds a light but efficient moisture back into your skin. Highly recommend!\n",
      "I do like the texture of this product, but I am not sure it is worth the price for such a small container.  I don't think the percentage of  hyaluronic acid is high enough to be that effective or differentiate this product from other moisturizers.  If you find it on sale, or you are not happy with your current moisturizer, I would say give it a try but otherwise, it is not quite as special as it could have been had Neutrogena really \"boosted\" the hyaluronic acid content.\n",
      "I've always had trouble finding the right moisturizer for my skin, since my face is naturally oily. This lotion has worked better than anything I've used before. It was recommended by dermatologist and I've been using it ever since. If you're on the fence about this, I urge you to just try it and you'll be amazed. It feels like you're putting water on your face\n",
      "Just wish there was more or a bundle pack  works well & came on my next day delivery\n",
      "This WORKS! Visible results in a span of 3-4 weeks with regular use!\n",
      "For me, it's totally not as awesome as I have heard people say it is. It's something to try though.\n",
      "Ordered this when I came to the conclusion that my beloved CeraVe is giving me cc's - as a reco from Curology. Unfortunately this stuff just doesn't absorb into my skin very well. It might be the gel texture, I typically do better with lotions instead. Will keep using until I run out but probably won't repurchase.\n",
      "Great gel cream.  So smooth, and light weight, and it's good for your face as well as your whole body, and doesn't burn eyes either, which is great!!I definitely recommend this.  Thank you!\n",
      "so far so good\n",
      "I like this very much. It has no scent at all which is a big plus for me, it’s hydrating, and makes my  skin feel soft. Completely non-greasy so I like to use it as a night cream.\n",
      "I got the fragrance free gel cream for extra dry skin. It absorbs quickly and feels light. I was suffering from dry, flakey, red skin under my eyes. I didn't want something with a strong fragrance near my eyes, so this gel is perfect. In just 4 days, my skin was no longer flakey. I might just survive through this long, cold winter!\n",
      "I absolutely love this stuff.  I will keep buying it.  It doesn't have \"old lady smell\" like so many lotions.\n",
      "Fantastic product and availability online was quick and easy. Will definitely buy again from them.\n",
      "I swear the lid had already been opened when I got it!\n",
      "Love the way this feels! Not greasy at all and has made a noticeable difference in the dry skin on my face.\n",
      "This mixes really well with my foundation or serves as a fine moisturizing base if I'm just applying cover-up or concealer. I've seen a slight boost in my skin's moisture levels. Combine this with Aveeno Positively Radiant Intensive Night Cream (also available at Amazon or your drugstore) and you have a great combination!\n",
      "This works really well for me. I use over the serum. May try the gel-creme as a night creme as I would like something a bit heavier at night. Eye gel-creme is also good!\n",
      "Skin is so soft now. It hasn't made me breakout either. I have combination skin.\n",
      "This is a miracle in a jar! I have extremely dry, sensitive skin and this product has been just as effective, if not more, than more expensive cremes, serums, gels that I've tried from department stores. Neutrogena has a winner here. I love the entire hydro-boost line!\n",
      "This product is excellent, but I prefer Neutrogena's hydrating serum. I don't like that this is in a tub, and for some reason the serum seems to last longer for me. The serum works better for my combination skin than the thicker gel that seems better for dry skin. This has zero fragrance, which is nice because the serum has a bit of the fragrance.While they are very similar, I prefer the serum over the gel due to the pump dispenser and working better with my skin type.\n",
      "Not sure if its working but im on my second bottle. I guess it is.\n",
      "This is an okay moisturizer.  Wish it were a little more of a thick cream rather than a thinner gel like consistency, I find my skin looks more luminous with Olay Regenerist in the red jar.\n",
      "I spent almost $500 a couple weeks ago with 30+ items in my cart. I will be reviewing the majority of the items. This was one of them.Wow! This is a fantastic moisturizer. I actually accidentally bought 2 and didn't notice it until I was looking at my orders. When yout put it on your face you have a shiny film, so I recommend putting a little bit on. It clears up your skin so well, and is just a wonderful moisturizer.\n",
      "Have not used it for very long, but I def see a difference in my skin. My skin is softer and has a better complexion. The only thing I dislike is the smell. I can't really explain what it smells like, but it's like an industrial smell def not a pleasant smell that you would think it would be. That really throws me off every time I put it on. Hope the smell gets better over time.\n",
      "I like this but I'm used to my other moisturizer.  I thought I'd give this a try in order to save some money but I went back to the other after a couple of weeks.\n",
      "First moisture that does not make me sweat.\n",
      "Works fine,  smells bad\n",
      "I was expecting it to be more moistyring\n",
      "Good for dry skin  especially on face  Barb Amaral\n",
      "I have been using Neutrogena Hydro Boost for about 6 months and I absolutely love it!! I have typically used the water gel but when this came up on Prime Day I thought I would give the gel-cream a try. I LOVE IT!! For mine and my husband's face (and some body product) needs we only use Neutrogena. They make an excellent product at a great value. If you are looking to help your face or even don't have dry skin you should give this product a try; your face will thank you! :) My face after using this feels like silk and even throughout the day my face feels soft, and it smells good too. My friend has very sensitive skin and cant use most face products, but she loves this one!! I love using this as a foundation base too! I dont know if this product was intended to help with acne, but as an adult in my early 30's I was still getting acne, and since using this product I have had fewer pimples, and I am also saving money since i don't need other products now! Thanks for making a great product!\n",
      "Ive heard alot of buzz about this product i the past few months. I was so excited when I was chosen to receive this from Influenster to test and review. I used this 2 times per day for over 2 weeks now. I used about a dime sized amount and it was more than enough to cover my face and neck. The product went on evenly and soaked in almost immediately.The smell was not too strong but it smelled clean and refreshing like a beach or a spa. I loved that this product did not leave my face dry or too oily but with the perfect amount of moisture. I used this moisturizer under my makeup and it helped my makeup last longer and stayed in place longer with fewer touch-ups. This is a great and innovative, new product!!! I received this product complimentary from Influenster to test and review. It did not influence my opinion. #BehindTheGlow #Neutrogena @Influenster @Neutrogena\n",
      "has perfume in it.\n",
      "Pretty much no scent --- very important for face creams.  If scent is too strong (or I don't like it, period) I can't stand having it on my face since there's no getting away from the smell amplified right by your nose.  Texture is perfect.  It goes on really light and mostly absorbs quickly so I can't tell it is still there but if I wet my face I can kind of feel it still on there somehow.  I have acne prone skin and have not had any problems yet.  I really dislike the other similar water gel style of this cream which has a very perfumey scent.\n",
      "This moisturizer is my go to. I have dry skin and this helps so much. I love it so much that I now subscribe and save to have it delivered regularly.\n",
      "I used $1.18 savings coupon at the checkout and even received the email receipt that the total shows the product amount minus $1.18. However, my credit card was charged the full price without $1.18 savings coupon amount. I need to receive this $1.18 credit. Also, the gel-creme didn't work for me. It just smeared and absorbed into my skin immediately without any moisturizing feeling on face. It felt very dry. Useless and disappointed.\n",
      "I have (had) dry/oily skin on my face and other creams and lotions I have tried just were not cutting it, they felt thick and greasy and just generally uncomfortable. I put this on and I feel almost nothing at all! if you're looking for a transparent, yet effective daily moisturizer definitely give this a try! I never realized how dry and tight my skin felt after a shower until I regularly started applying this right after and felt what my skin should actually feel like. great product.\n",
      "Finally! An affordable face moisturizer that really works! After appx 10 yrs of searching for a nice feeling, low odor, actually DOES moisturize, moisturizer, I believe this is it! Not being a top tier Hollywood star, I just couldn't afford $500 for an ampule of really good, made from the night time urine of a female Andean Mountain Goat with a brown spot in the middle of the forehead, mixed with the ashes of a red heifer, facial moisturizer that made my 60 yr old skin radiate like an 18 yr old. After watching several tv spots for this product and knowing that hyaluronic acid is one of the few things that really does make a difference, I zipped right out and bought me some. (did not purchase from this seller the 1st time) I've only been using it for about a wk and half but it's long enough to know that my skin definitely feels and looks better (oh, for that 18 yr old face again, sigh) after using it. More hydrated. There is no odor and no residue left on the skin. It is quickly absorbed (or evaporated?)  and ready for makeup. It feels good enough that I even skip my makeup primer occasionally (seeing as I use Estee Lauder foundation which IS buildable but not so much with primer). I've always like Neutrogena products but this is now my new fav. I'm going to be trying the other Hydro Boost products now also.\n",
      "I have horribly dry skin,  and this makes it silky smooth with no irritation  Will keep purchasing forever!!\n",
      "I have oily skin and since this is water-based, it doesn't feel think and heavy on my face. I highly recommend!\n",
      "Love this for my combination skin.\n",
      "I use this several times a day, its not greasy, but absorbs beautifully.  I wear it under and over my face makeup it I put it on also.\n",
      "Goes on nicely, feels refreshing, I still look 65!\n",
      "OK REVISED.  I have worn this , for 3 weeks est as got snowed in, so could not take it back.. I like it alot.. It has not broken me out. It has restored my skin back to few years ago..I am not having to use it off and on all day anymore as I was terribly dry<< I had used a brand drugstore brand that is to revitalize..and it dried me to scales..that and not doing any skin care in several years...busy gal,. so now, lines have gotten less so...even around my mouth..my skin is SOFT...and not greasy...it can be thick around eyes..so use tiny amt..and I did get some in my eye lol..my stupidity...but its Ok now..my skin has not been this soft, and not greasy or heavy feeling from a skin cream in my entire,,,older years..I use it on my neck too...it does have a barrier...but after your skin restores to less dry and, not flaking..I used a lil skin cream called hydrotone..i ordered off somewhere years ago..still smelt and looked good,,,while i was de-scaling my poor skin..im 54,,been not into caring for myself a lot as stay busy..artist and other stuff..so..I look younger than many my age..not bragging...i was looking very harsh..so..I prob will add a eye and lip product later..lip , so lipstick will not feather and for lip care,,but I LOVE THIS STUFF <<<NO BREAKOUTS..NO GOOP..JUST  ONCE A DAY NOW OR TWO IF I FEEL LIKE IT..I wash my face a lot in the day anyway..so need a it more from doing that..I am going to give it five stars as I have bought very expensive products in my life and. did not do this..GEL CREAM. extra dry...:).\n",
      "good\n",
      "This just feels good as soon as it touches my skin.  It absorbs instantaneously and skin feels hydrated for quite awhile.\n",
      "It's okay I guess but I find the Garnier gel to be wayy more effective! When I put this on my dry skin it still looks and feels dry even when the lotion feels moist on my face it's confusing. It's okay to sleep overnight with that's when I actually notice a little but I have spent less money on much better and much more oz's of product. It would probably work well for someone with less dry skin.\n",
      "Wish I could give zero stars. Product received & the product was not sealed & very noticeable that it had been used\n",
      "Well gel-cream is certainly an appropriate name because it feels like a bit of both. It's got the consistency and cool feel of a gel but the cream aspect comes in the form of the white color and seems to lessen the feeling that it's a gel. It's definitely weird as someone who prefers creams and lotions. It also does dry quickly on your skin and has a matte finish, so no shine. I'd say this is best for those with oily skin and is probably nice for those with sensitive skin. But there's better products out there anyway - this is just all marketing. On the plus side, this seems to do more moisturizing than the barely there Oil Free line of moisturizers that Neutrogena has. Those felt like water on my skin and had even less moisture.This definitely doesn't moisturize enough for someone with dry skin and might not even be enough for someone with normal skin. I actually find that cheapo Curel Daily Healing Lotion Original for Dry Skin does a far better job of moisturizing than this. I was hoping to find something better but this wasn't it. I shouldn't be surprised when the hyaluronic acid (sodium hyaluronate) is near the end of the ingredient list, so it's probably only there in tiny amounts. For now I'm back to Curel until I can find something that offers more for my skin than just good moisturization.\n",
      "When I received my product, I was a little excited. I love skin care. Something to help moisturize? This is great! I was anticipating a few small pouches, little bottles or .3oz tubes. No. They sent a full size product to test. The packaging is sleek and \"clean\" looking, as per most Neutrogena products. The tub is a crystal blue, and to me that emphasizes the product as it's for hydrating. It fits. It kind of looks like candy. The product itself, I've been using it for about two weeks now. I naturally have oily combination skin. It's so dry in some places, oily in others, but oily ALL OVER because of how dry it is. Anything that is light and sets fast is great for this. I noticed most of it's effect on my neck. I normally don't use much of anything on my neck, but this having hyaluronic acid, I went for it. My neck is smooth. My neck wrinkles, albeit small, have smoothed out.  My skin overall has plumped. I give this product an A+. I will be buying this until they decide to discontinue it, like every other thing everyone loves.I received this product for free in exchange for my unbiased review through Crowdtap, from Neutrogena, and I do completely love it.\n",
      "Received the package and looked like someone had already torn open the plastic around the box. I'm skeptical about using the product because of possible tampering.\n",
      "This product has fulfilled it's purpose, I specifically chose to purchase the gel formulated for extra dry skin. It has essentially no scent, and it goes on incredibly well. the texture is very light, however, I must warn that you need to use the correct amount otherwise it may get slightly sticky. it does leave a healthy appearing hydration that can easily be enjoyed, it also works very well to hydrate dry or potentially drying skin. The only issue that accommodates this item specifically is it's ability to sting on sensitive skin types. I would personally recommend doing a small patch test for 2-3 days to determine whether or not this product is compatible with your skin type.\n",
      "I saw the great reviews and thought I'd give it a try. I was in need of a moisturizer and liked this one because it was a gel. Most cream moisturizers are too heavy for me and clog my pores. However, I haven't had good results from this gel moisturizer. Right off the bat, it did not feel moisturizing going on. It literally felt like I was rubbing hair gel on my face. It's not sticky, but it did leave my face feeling a bit tight and stretched. Not only that, but it actually made my skin feel dryer afterwards. My chin area was especially dry and irritated. I also noticed an increase in noticeable blackheads, and my cystic acne which had actually been cleared up for a while, came back full flare. It might work great for a lot of people, just not me. Unfortunately I have very finnicky skin =/\n",
      "nice and smooth\n",
      "This leaves my face feeling soft, smooth, and hydrated.  Has no noticable fragrance to me.I like Garnier Skinactive Moisture Rescue Refreshing Gel Cream ( $6 for the same 1.7 oz jar ) just as well and it has a nice light floral scent to it.\n",
      "Dries up very quickly, bad choice for dry skin.\n",
      "Love it...boomers need good hydration that absorbs.\n",
      "Trerrific, as always!\n",
      "Magic! Great moisture without the oiliness! Great for those thirsty summer days!\n",
      "Amazing product - use it twice a day.  Mix it early morning with my liquid makeup for a smooth application and once again in the evening before going to bed.  A little expensive, but worth the extra $$.  I have been using this product for over 2 years.\n",
      "Very high quality well absorbed product. Price was OK compared to comparable higher end products.\n",
      "I have excema and my face is one of my hardest places to keep under control. It gets so dry sometimes it cracks and peels. I bought this and have been using it as my first layer after washing my face. It feels so good when I put it on and after it dries my face is so soft. It isn't thick, so I will admit I put Vanicream over it. But, that's only because of my excema. Otherwise I could just use the hydroboost. Then my foundation. I love it!!\n",
      "I was really disappointed with this product. It seemed to have so many great reviews so I had high expectations. I have very dry patches on my skin right now due to the cold, dry winter weather. (T zone more oily). After the product fully absorbed (which was quickly) my dry spots were still VERY dry. I'd have been better off using my normal moisturizer.\n",
      "good for sensitive skin\n",
      "My face feel so smooth!\n",
      "I have extremely sensitive, red, dry skin that hates me. I was using a moisturizer that I really loved but cost $$$ so I tried this one as they have similar ingredients. I'm now on my third jar of this. It's the best I've ever used. Not greasy or sticky, no scent, not irritating, cheap and super moisturizing. I pair it with the serum and these ceramide capsules I also found on Amazon and my skin's moisture barrier is now repaired!\n",
      "I love this product\n",
      "it does make my skin soft, but pricey for the small amount in the jar.\n",
      "I am/have always been a Neutrogena girl. I love this cream. I cant go without it. Im not going to tell you that you are going to wake up and look 20, because you wont. But your face will feel clean, less puffy, not sticky and after using it at night I never wake up with a lizard face and my face just feels better. I have never broken out from this and oddly enough my dude loves it too! I wont go to sleep without it on my face!\n",
      "This is truly the greatest product I have ever bought for my skin!! I've never written a review for anything before but felt so strongly about my love for this I needed to! I have been suffering from severely dry skin for most of my life! NOTHING has helped! I've tried it all. It goes on smoothly and a little goes a long ways! And the best part is that I no longer have the embarrassing flaking skin on my face!\n",
      "Love the smell of this product.  It glides onto the skin.\n",
      "As a male I'm not shy to admit that the last thing I thought I would be writing a review for is moisturizing facial gel. I love this product. I work outside all day everyday and my skin pays the price. I always have raccoon eyes from safety glasses and windburn/sunburn on my cheeks. I have been using this product for 10 days now and I have had excellent results. The windburn is slowly going away, the few wrinkles I have are less noticeable, and dry skin and flaking is non existent. Neutrogena gets my vote!\n",
      "Love most of Neutrogena products!\n",
      "Great stuff!\n",
      "First, I'm over 50, which may be the reason this was a \"like\", not a \"love\" product for me.  I bought the \"cream\" version of this product specifically because my skin tends to need a bit heavier moisturizer.  I love the \"gel\" texture.  It doesn't take much and it goes on easily and absorbs quickly. It does make my skin look instantly better - less dry, more plump.  HOWEVER, it just doesn't last.  Within minutes, I feel like I need to add more moisture.  I do like using it under my daytime SPF moisturizer...almost like a \"primer\".  But, I haven't decided if I will buy it again or not.  When I was younger, I think this would have been a wonderful moisturizer.  Now, I'm not sure it's made for mature skin and will be more costly for me to have to buy this and an additional moisturizer.\n",
      "Better than most creams.  I like the gel and it's good for really dry skin.  We live in the mtns where there his low humidity, so very dry skin.\n",
      "Very nice if you're experiencing menopausal acne like me.\n",
      "I like Neutroena face products. This is no exception. Hydrates and is clean feeling. My dry skin isn't so dry anymore. Thankfully. I'll keep buying this product.\n",
      "Soothing and easy to spread\n",
      "So hydrating. If you have really dry skin like me you'll find it really refreshing to put on.\n",
      "Ladies, I have always used Neutrogena Gentle Cleanser and this wonderdul Gel. Someone convinced me to start using Philosophy products (Purity) and all of a sudden I have lines in my forehead and 11 lines between eyes. Never again! I'm 50 and get compliments on my complexion and Neutrogena is responsible for that. Also the Gel is wonderful for Florida where you don't want greasy. Love it, will never stray.\n",
      "This stuff makes my face feel so nice and hydrated, without feeling greasy.\n",
      "I wanted to try this and it is very nice\n",
      "This does wonders for my skin! It absorbs much better than other cream based moisturizers and I really see a difference in the way my skin looks and feels.\n",
      "LOVE THIS PRODUCT!  Switched from a MUCH more expensive  department store brand and this works much better!\n",
      "I love this product! Target doesn't always carry the \"Extra-dry\" Hydro Boost, and I like it the best because it has no scent. I'm glad I can count on Amazon to have what I'm looking for!\n",
      "Great product !\n",
      "I like the product however, when I opened up the jar, it was 1/4 full - meaning 3/4 EMPTY.  What did I pay for?  Very disappointed.\n",
      "Did not work well for me at all. Still very dry skin.\n",
      "The only reason I don't like it and won't buy it again is that it has a fragrance, and I can't handle fragrances.\n",
      "Despite it being the most expensive moisturizer I've ever bought in my life, I obeyed my dermatologist's orders and started using this gel-cream. The results? Moisturized, non-greasy, non-oily skin. Normally, I have to change moisturizers with the season. I've been using this moisturizer for a year now and none else. IT EVEN HOLDS UP TO SOUTH TEXAS HEAT, which honestly makes it worth the cost for that alone. A+ Neutrogena, A+.\n",
      "Happy with this product, no issues at all.\n",
      "this is the best feeling moisturizer I have ever used. it has a cooling feel so it's so refreshing!\n",
      "I received my first jar as a gift and didn't get what all the buzz was about until I did my research and learned how to use it. Now I love it and am about to order my 3rd jar. I think the negative reviews are because most people, like me, try to use it as a stand alone moisturizer. I learned that it is a humectant and and works well applied a WET skin to lock in moisture. Let it dry, then use whatever serums and moisturizers you prefer for day or night. Try it this way and I think you'll be pleased with the results.\n",
      "Love it!\n",
      "Works well on my skin. High quality product\n",
      "I got this for my daughter because he skin was getting really dry.  She says this works great without making her skin feel greasy.  I tried it a couple of times and it helps.  It was very cool to the skin and had a few light feel.\n",
      "Love this is not heavy like a cream and absorbs quickly!\n",
      "I have a mixture of excema and psoriasis on my face and scalp. I have been so embarrassed about the dry flakes of skin on my cheeks for so long. About two weeks of use with this lotion and I can hardly see any flakes now!\n",
      "I ordered this because I really like the original Neutrogena Hydro Boost Gel-Cream and thought I would test out the Extra-Dry formula. The thing I liked about the original was how light weight, cooling and fast absorbing it is. Unfortunately this formula doesn't have the same cooling effect. It is still gel like but my skin takes a little longer to absorb it. Still nice lightweight but having tried the original which made my skin feel amazing I would say if your skin is super-dry and you don't want a heavy cream this is for you. If you don't necessarily have dry skin go with the original. If you have dry skin and just want something that will quench and soothe fast your better off with a heavier cream.\n",
      "Was used to apply foundation daily for more than half a year. My face never seemd fresh enough to go without it. Atfer using this for one week, I finally felt ok and confindent to use only concealer under my eyes.The face looks so healthy and fresh.Feels like thick water. Not greasy at all, absorbs very fast, doesn’t leave your face sticky (as a lot of other moisturizers do).\n",
      "There’s a difference between this (the water gel-cream) and the water gel.I’m oily and wanted to try the water gel since the water gel is regarded as a holy grail for oily skin, but I bought this by mistake; it’s pretty alright, it absorbs quickly and provides some oil control. It feels a bit sticky, though.\n",
      "the same result as any other moisturizer. The difference is that this sits on top of my skin rather than soaking in or evaporating away, but not in any beneficial way.  No matter how long I allow it to soak in, whenever I put foundation on and attempt to spread, the moisturizer clumps up and rolls away into the direction that I am blending my makeup.  I usually can't wear makeup with this because if I do (tried all different makeup brands) it clumps, rolls and is so blotchy that I have to take it all off, wash my face and start over without using this.  Oh yeah, I forgot about how some of the makeup changes color when it reacts to this moisturizer, so that's cool.I wish I got that perfectly dewy, smooth, glowing, pore free skin that the commercial shows!  I guess clumpy, blotchy, and bizaar is kind of similar, in a completely opposite kind of way.\n",
      "Liked the product.  Not greasy or sticky. Moisture’s well.  I will not purchase again until they change the packaging.  They used so much plastic for the package, as shown in the photo.  I wish I noticed this before buying because I would not have purchased for this reason alone.\n",
      "A must for women over 50! Love the soft feel. Non-greasy!  Only takes a dab! Use twice a day.\n",
      "Love it! Feels great on my skin\n",
      "My skin seems to be a little drier since I started using this.  About 5 minutes after I apply it, if I rub my forehead, it rubs off.  I've been moisturizing for 25 years now and I've never experienced anything like it.  Not impressed at all.\n",
      "I just purchased this about two weeks ago and have been wearing it every day since then. In the past I hadn't been able to find facial moisturizers light enough to wear under makeup - they always left my skin feeling like it had a coating on it that air couldn't get through to, and eventually my face would start sweating. I have dry and sensitive skin on my cheeks, but my nose and chin are more of a normal type that easily gets shiny looking by the middle of the day. This addresses all of my issues - moisturizing where I need it, but without being too heavy for the rest of my skin. Best of all? My skin feels like it can breathe! As a side note, I have had no issues with sensitivity and there is not a scent that I (at least) can detect.\n",
      "GREAT night cream!\n",
      "Teen daughter uses daily and loves it.  Not greasy, and keeps her skin from feeling tight and dry. Does not cause any breakouts.\n",
      "good choice!\n",
      "I live in Denver, and the altitude leaves me with dry, flaky skin. This moisturizer feels like a cool splash of water that lasts. It's a gel consistency rather than a cream, which absorbs into the skin rather than sitting on top of it. 10/10 would recommend!\n",
      "Excellent for very sensitive skin. No fragrance problems, no breakouts. Bringing my skin back to life! Their lighter formula (not for extra-dry skin) would be great also but it has too much fragrance for me...\n",
      "Feels good , don't know if it works\n",
      "The best product out there\n",
      "By far my favorite moisturizer. SO hydrating. This really soaks in to my skin instead of just sitting on top of it like most moisturizers. And there is no oily or greasy residue. Very refreshing. 10 of 10 would recommend.\n",
      "Love, love, love this product! I used this at night before bed after washing my face and sometimes in the mornings. Left my face feeling smooth, moisturized, no more dryness! I recited this product free and my opinions are all my own.\n",
      "Love the product\n",
      "Feels great! You feel it from the second you apply it and never goes away! I finally found my product! Soft and smooth! Looking great so far!\n",
      "Reorder\n",
      "It worked as a miracle product for dry, sensitive, aging skin. Highly recommend!\n",
      "NIce\n",
      "Awesome.Great price.Put it on before bed.Tried the rest and this is the best..Skin feels nourished.Great smell.Skin looks and feels revitalised.Doesnt make your skin feel oily either. Easily absorbed into the skin. The consistency of this moisturizer is amazing !\n",
      "I am not prone to acne and this made me have breakouts.\n",
      "Noticed no difference, I think Olay products give you better results.\n",
      "I have extremely dry skin and this moisturizer works wonders on my face. It isn't heavy or oily, but still provides plenty of hydration. This is by far my favorite moisturizer.\n",
      "My wife says this is only okay.  Pretty high price for the amount.\n",
      "I absolutely love this product.  I have been using it for over a year and I highly recommend to anyone with dry ageing skin.  I use it after bath at night and under my makeup in the morning.  It is fantastic\n",
      "My  anethestatician recommended this to me. I LOVE it! It is light, and very hydrating. It doesn't feel heavy or greasy. I feel like the fine lines near my eyes are not as noticeable and are fading. I reorder this product every time!\n",
      "This is not good if you have extra dry skin. I have had to use a moisturizer on top of it to keep my face from chapping\n",
      "Not for me. My sister loves this stuff but it's not for me. It's light weight in the jar, but feels weird on my skin.\n",
      "I LOVE this facial lotion! It keeps my face soft and hydrated all day.\n",
      "i don't use anything else\n",
      "I don't know if any of these things work.  This product seems to moisturize well under my eyes.  I don't know if it's age-defying as others suggest... But good to use morning and night\n",
      "It caused a bad breakout within a couple of weeks. I have clear skin generally and combination skin.\n",
      "I guess it works like lotion. It has not remotely changed my skin. I drank an extra three glasses of water a day and saw noticeable improvement in my under-eye skin. I have used this for a few weeks and have noticed nothing. A giant, heavy container with a tiny bit of lotiony stuff. I'll stick with Cetaphil, which is waaaay cheaper and feels nice on my skin.\n",
      "This cream is not the sticky kind and also doesnt have any smell, so pretty much what I had in mind.\n",
      "I first purchased this in a drug store. Really good hydration and much better price here.\n",
      "After just a few days of using this product, my skin became so much more manageable! I thought I had oily skin, but it was really producing that oil since it was too dry! Who would have thought?! My poor are smaller, I have a glow to my skin, and makeup stays on better. Note: I use this once a day before bed at night.\n",
      "Works well.  We routinely purchase.  Speedy shipping 😊\n",
      "I have very dry skin during the winter, I've been using it for 2 weeks now and my skin seems to have improved. It's not nice for before makeup, not heavy and dries fast!\n",
      "I love this! I usually hate wearing moisturizer because most products make my skin feel very heavy. This moisturizer, however, is very light weight and absorbs quickly. Even is my face is very dry, only one application of this product, and my skin feels renewed. I’ve already started telling my friends and family that they need to try this product!\n",
      "Loved the product when first purchased. Price has steadily gone up from my original $13 and change to the current $17 and change. At this price I will just pay the additional few dollars and by the Clinique gel moisturizer.\n",
      "Not want I expected.  Trashed it.\n",
      "Love how my skin feels and looks after I put this on. So soft and almost glowing.\n",
      "My new favorite night cream and I have tried them all! Much better than olay regenerist cream. Not sticky not thick.\n",
      "My skin loves this stuff! I use it in the mornings before make up. It makes my skin look refreshed without being super heavy. It also plumps my lips up too which is wonderful!\n",
      "This is the only moisturizer that I have ever truly fell in love with. It's a gel based moisturizer which makes the face feel like you are massaging water into your skin. Hydrating rather than the other oily products out there. Use it twice a day. You will notice your skin looking a lot more youthful and radiant. Hope this was helpful\n",
      "This gel goes on nice and smooth and feels really well on your face.  I switched from my usual cream to this, and even ordered additional.  It left my face moist and with no shine.  Highly recommended.\n",
      "Solid moisturizer in the AM/early afternoon. Little greasy but blends in quickly. Perhaps using a tissue later in the day will ease the residue. Does a nice job filling in those crow's feet! Clear cream. Little bit goes a long way.\n",
      "yes\n",
      "Really good for dry frigid winters without leaving greasy residue on my skin. My new go-to.\n",
      "Not impressed.  Have very dry skin thought this may help.\n",
      "I love the product but I rated with 1 star because it looked like somebody already opened and used.  It wasn't full and there was no seal at all.  The lid had some stain on it.  I feel cheated.\n",
      "Always happy with the product and the Amazon price! I usually get the water hell, but this time I ordered both the gel-cream and the sun screen- I prefer the gel to the gel cream but I'm still going to use it as I trust the product- the gel cream is just a little more tacky on the skin and takes longer to dry. A plus is that the smell is much softer than the water gel, like barely there. The spf has a kettle bit of a typical sun block smell, & the texture is really nice!\n",
      "Very good product...skin soft and moisturized after just a few applications ...more than pleased!\n",
      "It's worth the price. Decent amount for how little you need to use. If you use too much it might feel sticky and take longer to soak into your skin. I'm not a HUGE fan of the texture upon applying but once it dries the feeling goes away. I didn't see the results until the next morning after wearing it for a day, but you really do see results. Skin looks refreshed and glows. I feel that you need to use it for a couple of days to see noticeable results. I'm on day 3 and my skin seems to be getting better & better....\n",
      "The skin just glows.\n",
      "This is my favorite face cream.  Not sure if it does anything for wrinkles, but it applies very smoothly and does not leave a greasy finish at all.  Perfect for under makeup or for combination skin.\n",
      "Excellent product for all skin types.\n",
      "LOVE this face cream,, it is light and softens dry skin without greasy feeling, I use it day and night, nice light scent also.\n",
      "Feels good on my skin and really seems to lock in the moisture!\n",
      "My face is sensitive to scent and certain products.  My face is also a combo dry skin so it’s hard to find products that can hydrant my skin during the dry seasons. But this moisturizer is great. A little goes a long way too. Very light going on and leaves my skin feeling smooth.\n",
      "Superb product!!\n",
      "I really like this moisturizer.  It really makes your skin feel refreshed and moisturized\n",
      "Love this\n",
      "Even though the bottle is small, a little goes a long way. In addition, the more you use it, the more time you have in between having to re-moisturize. My face actually feels like a baby's skin. I use this with the accompanying serum and most days I don't need the cream. However, winter is coming and I know that this cream will be my face's best friend. It, as well as the serum, makes a great lip moisturizer in a pinch. They need to make a body lotion with this stuff.\n",
      "Love it!\n",
      "Great for my over 55 skin. Hyaluronic acid is an expensive and most effective ingredient to have in your skin care.  This is an amazing price for the quality & quantity of product!Will not be without it!\n",
      "It's okay - nothing special. It may be that now that I'm older I need a heavier moisturizing cream. It goes on light, dries quickly, I just feel like I need more moisturizing.\n",
      "Love\n",
      "Favorite hydration gel! Love that it is fragrance free and great for sensitive skin.\n",
      "Great at moisturizing my oily sensitive skin without irritating it.\n",
      "This has been the only thing that wont make my face breakout!!! I am THRILLED to after 24 years of trying to stop my dry face from dry patches and craters\n",
      "Wasteful packaging. Nice refreshing cream.\n",
      "Saw an ad or on t.v. & decided to try itbecause my face has been super dry.It totally makes my face soft & hydrated.No fragrance, dyes, etc. I have kind ofsensitive skin when it comes to fragrance& this product didn't make my face breakout or anything, just totally hydrated it.I use a lot of Neutrogena products &this one is another great one. Highlyrecommend it.\n",
      "Helpful for us dry skinned gals!\n",
      "I will preface this review with stating I have normal but sensitive skin that gets very dry in winterI have tried many moisturizers spanning less expensive Neutrogena and Olay products, to Murad and Clinique moisturizers. For an overall product taking into consideration the benefits and cost, this is my favorite hands down. This product does not cause shiny or oily skin for me. It absorbs into my skin quickly and gives it a very soft feel. It does a fantastic job at keeping my face hydrated, without any of the negative effects that are common with moisturizers. Be mindful that there is no SPF and a small pea sized amount is all you really need.\n",
      "I signed up for the subscribe and save option and glad I did. It lasted me two months because a little goes a long way. I am a 28 yr old female of south eastern origins with a combination normal to oily skin, prone to adult acne. With all the acne products I have been using on my face I started noticing how dry and flaky my skin was. All other lotions (from cheap to expensive ones) all made my face even oiler and by the end of the day my face would be so shiny. This lotion i could tell left my face nice and hydrated and helped with my adult acne. After washing my face I would put it on and let it settle, giving my skin time to absorb it. It left my face feeling light and refreshed. I loved the feeling so much that I ended up replacing my high end primer with a neutrogena one and also am trying the overnight lotion. I think the combo has left my face glowy, improved my complexion and lightened up my dark spots.\n",
      "Love it!!! Face looks younger.\n",
      "Works great!  I use first then put a face garnier ultra lift on. 👍\n",
      "Great moisturizer. Will continue to order this product. Thanks to PrimeI can save myself a trip to store which is often out of product. Thanks.\n",
      "Love that it moistures without greasiness!  It is weightless.  Will buy a gain! Great price & fast shipping!\n",
      "Amazing! Gives my oily acne prone skin so much moisture but with no sticky, tacky, or heavy feeling after.\n",
      "My jar's ingredients has no retinol listed\n",
      "Best stuff\n",
      "Absolutely love it. Started using in the summer. Worked great for the drying effects of the sun from the beach or the tanning bed. I use it every morning and evening or whenever I wash my face. It smells fantastic and makes my face feel amazing. And believe me I am a product SNOB!  lol.. If something doesn't work I stop using it. But this works. Now with winter coming and our forced air heat my skin gets very dry. Just remember ladies and gentlemen if you have severe symptoms on your face this cream gel isn't going to be working magic over night or even one month. There isn't a genie in this jar... Lol. Give it a real chance use it religiously and you will see some changes and benefits. I'm sure of it. My skin feels so soft and smooth. I love it.\n",
      "I have very sensitive skin, and this works wonders. I use it day and night. Love it!\n",
      "This really works.. I use it all the time now..Morning & evening.  Can even use it under my makeup after it dries a little.\n",
      "This product is very soothing to my skin.  I like Neutrogena products.\n",
      "Another favorite of mine in my rotation of face creams.  Very different form others I use.  It feels glorious on the face and I love to use it.  Since I don't use any one face cream exclusively but rather rotate among 4 or 5, I can't say what kind of effect it has other than my face stays well moisturized this way and I especially like the way this one feels.\n",
      "Already tried the hydro-gel, like hydro cream better, fragrance free, slightly thicker texture than hydro-gel and hydrate skin well without break out.\n",
      "Very soothing and cool....\n",
      "I had super high hopes for this product because of the promoted ingredient hyaluronic acid, but it doesn't stack up. Don't get me wrong, Neutrogena's Hydro Boost Gel Cream (Gel Cream, really?) comes in a beautiful jar with a high end look, it has a nice light high end smell, can be kinda pricey (for Neutrogena, depending on where you buy it) and feels amazing going on your skin but only an hour after my skin is in the same condition pre-application. I have combination skin, but I am inching towards 40, eek, and have some dry spots. I was looking for the reported benefits of hyaluronic acid of plumping and adding moisture and while I did get this amazing benefits for a short while they where just that, only there for a short while, no matter how much I slathered on. I think I will try a product that uses more of this key ingredient next time.\n",
      "Since I retired due to illness 24 years ago I had to stop using $500 Chanel. Once I found the Neutrogena facial line I am as delighted as when I could afford Chanel monthly.\n",
      "I have been looking for a moisturizer for the longest, my skin sucks this up, its not sticky, pure moisture. I really like it.\n",
      "I have been using hyaluronic acid off and on for a while. I have been buying the overpriced stuff that my esthetician sells so when I saw Neutrogena hydro boost I was excited. I have read some of the customer reviews and have noticed that a lot of people’s responses are 1) this doesn’t moisturize enough and 2) the smell. I bought the gel cream, and this actually works better than a lot of the high end products I was using before! Most hyaluronic acid serums are meant to be used in combination with a lotion. So if these buyers are buying just the gel, it wouldn’t feel the same throughout the day as a lotion or cream. The cream gel however seems to be both the serum and a moisturizer making this perfect for keeping skin hydrated. It states that this is for extra dry skin, but I think it would be ok for everyone except the truly oily.There were also complaints I noticed about the smell. Maybe the gel does have a perfume in it, but the gel cream is fragrance free. So if there are concerns about smell or sensitive skin, the gel cream would be a great choice.Overall, Neutrogena Hydro Boost holds up the higher end serums (I was spending $50+ previously). I am thrilled (and so is my wallet) to have found this!\n",
      "Nice, light moisturizer without feeling built up or greasy. Only complaint is the container I purchase had very little contents.\n",
      "I have used this for a few years now.  I love the way that it keeps my face moisturized.\n",
      "So far this has helped with my wrinkles and dryness. I find it a good buy.\n",
      "Refreshingly hydrating\n",
      "I tried this for a few nights and one day woke up with very irritated skin. My face was extremely dry, bumpy, tight, red and burning...it was a mess. My skin wouldn't absorb any moisturizer (not even Cetaphil/CeraVe) because it was so dry, and I had to go to a dermatologist who told me that something in this cream caused contact dermatitis (as it was the only recent change in my skincare). Disappointed, had to return it.One star because it absorbed into my skin quite well.\n",
      "I really like the Hydro Boost line.  I didn't realize that this was the \"Extra Dry Skin\" version however and wasn't as happy with the scent.\n",
      "Very nice product.  I will continue to use it.\n",
      "I have really dry skin and maybe I needed to try this product for longer but after a week of using it, I saw no improvement in my skin so I stopped. I felt like compared to other products, this left my skin looking and feeling drier soon after application and I found myself reapply multiple times per day. No thanks.\n",
      "Love most Neutrogena products but this one didn't do anything for me. Neutrogena must do better than this. So sorry.Better save your money until they get it right. Yoe Yoya.\n",
      "Light feeling cream that provides great moisture. It does not feel greasy and works well under my makeup. Definitely recommend.\n",
      "I love this stuff, it feels good and really makes a difference. I recommend it for aging skin, I see a difference. I highly recommend it.\n",
      "It just a plastic can you can't even use it for a month I thought I last me for a month usage and it didn't.I'm not satisfied with products, I used several brands and it's the worst cream I've used.Thanks for on time shipping\n",
      "This stuff is amazing. My dermatologist told me to get it because she said my skin was dry. I always thought it was oily. Weird. Anyway, this said it was for very dry skin so I thought it was definitely going to be thick and heavy and gross. Man. This stuff is great. It goes on and sinks in and feels almost like a primer. I put my makeup on right over it! It doesn’t make me greasy during the day ether! I highly recommend this product!!\n",
      "I absolutely LOVE it!!! I have really dry skin, especially my face after I wash it in the mornings. I could never find anything that worked until I tried this! It keeps my skin looking/feeling soft all day long! Will never use another product!\n",
      "I didn't  feel that this is particularly nourishing nor did I notice any change in my skin.\n",
      "This is the worst dry skin cream you could ever buy! The cream doesn't moisturize your skin at all. It simply evaporates on application! My skin stays just as dry as it was before. No difference on application.Ponds dry skin cream works better for my skin.\n",
      "Absolutely amazing! Quick dry and makes skin feel smooth and moisturized. Exactly what I was looking for.\n",
      "This is an excellent product, and it's much cheaper than many other brand moisturizers. My skin literally soaks it up within half a minute and my skin is smoother and it doesn't dry up during the day. I'd definitely recommend this version over the regular one since the extra dry skin version of the product doesn't have the overwhelming scent. The scent isn't too bad, but I do prefer the one without the blue dye and scent. It absorbs very quickly and it doesn't require additional applications during the day, unless you wash your face. Will buy again.\n",
      "exactly what my wife wanted.\n",
      "A product i have used before and it never disappoints!\n",
      "Great consistency, very smooth. Nice cooling sensation. This is the second time I've purchased it and it's made my skin very soft. Really great after a tough workout bc it's very refreshing!\n",
      "Another product that doesn't live up to it's hype.  OK moisturizer.  This product is a gel and has an unpleasant slippery feel.  Overall, overpriced.\n",
      "I have chronic dry skin, eczema, and my face flakes. I had tried everything from coconut oil to heavy moisturizers and nothing seemed to work, I either saw no significant difference or I broke out. This stuff, though, is a miracle and the price is amazing. It is the ONLY THING that has helped with my dry skin without breaking me out.I would say that this is a MUCH CHEAPER (but just as amazing) dupe for:- Peter Thomas Roth Water Drench Hylauronic Cloud Cream ($50)- Bliss Fabulous Drench 'N' Quench Cream to Water Lock-in Moisturizer ($40)So I would definitely recommend trying this out before heading to your local Ulta or Sephora and buying the expensive stuff.\n",
      "I love this cream/gel. I have sensitive combination skin, and have found that this works perfectly as a night moisturizer. The Hyaluronic acid is PERFECT for combo skin or sensitive skin! It really leaves the skin feeling silky soft, I just wish the container actually contained more product as I run through it very quickly.\n",
      "I have very dry skin and this feels SO GREAT on my face. It's not greasy and dries quickly, leaves my skin soft and smooth!\n",
      "Love it!\n",
      "Feels very cooling and hydrating. Skin feels smooth after applying.\n",
      "It's refreshing, cooling and moisturizing all for a very low price. I wear this under my heavier moisturizer and/or foundation. I've also applied it after serum to lock in the serum.\n",
      "good buy\n",
      "Great price, not greasy, and my fave.\n",
      "Pretty moisturizing, good for winter use, but somehow irritates my skin. My face kinda burns every time I put it on, and I have normal skin, not sensitive. Just be careful.\n",
      "I bought this elsewhere and it was much more expensive, I will be buying it on Amazon for now on!  This product is wonderful for the winter! My skin peels and itches badly during the winter but with this, it looks beautiful!\n",
      "I use several creams/moisturizers during a day.  I used the regular hydro boost and like this better as a night Cream.  It's creamier without being oily.\n",
      "I love this cream gel. It feels like a thirst quencher for my skin. My skin feels smooth hours after using it. It never feels heavy or too sticky and doesn't make my combination skin too shiny.\n",
      "This goes on like silk and makes my skin feel supple and bright. It is light enough to use morning and night. Highly recommend!\n",
      "Makes my skin feel amazing!! :)\n",
      "It’s ok.\n",
      "This moisturizer literally saved my skin!  I took a detour into K-beauty and decided that double-cleansing was exactly what I needed.  Holy crap, what a disaster.  My dry/combo skin totally rebelled (as it should have) and my face itched so badly that I was literally scratching at my skin searching for some kind of relief.  None of my moisturizers could touch it. I was so close to splurging on Kiehls and came across an article on dermatologist-recommended moisturizers for dry, inflamed skin and this was one of the top picks.  Bought a tub and haven't looked back.  My skin immediately felt relieved and I haven't had any issues since (although, I did abandon the double cleansing as well).  I also haven't had any issues with acne developing as a result of use.  It's unscented and I only need a small amount (I just lightly dip two fingers into the moisturizer) to cover my entire face with a light layer at night. I'm on my second tub and am finding that one tub usually lasts me about 6 months.  I have always had luck with Neutrogena products--in fact, I use them exclusively for face washes and scrubs, acne treatments, lotions/moisturizers, and sunscreen.  This product just adds to my love for the brand.\n",
      "I LOVE this stuff.\n",
      "Recommended by physician\n",
      "I've waited a long time before trying this and oh, man am I sorry I did! Yep, that's right, I am sorry for waiting!Let me start by saying I am half black, half white, have oily skin, even with tanning, and! I live in Florida near the gulf coast aka, humidity capital of the world.  I've been lucky to have pretty great skin, not a ton of breakouts but they do happen, but I was terrified of using any lotions, until I turned 27 and my skin started to show that I don't take proper precautions. So, I tried this and again, WHAT WAS I WAITING FOR?! this is a wonderful product! The eye cream is great but this, oh man! I apply it before bed, post shower (and I tan, a lot) and I've noticed that my skin is actually loving it! And even better, no breakouts! (Minus the normal pms simpletons) so if your looking for something for all skin types, especially oily, that feels good and not one  bit greasy or makes your face sweat more, especially in Florida heat, you found it!!\n",
      "Wife loves this stuff and I love the price on amazon.\n",
      "This makes my skin very soft. I think it has made my skin look better after about a week.\n",
      "I got a sample of this moisturizer from my dermatologist and I love it. I looked for the best price to buy a bottle and Amazon beat out CVS and the other drug stores. I have bought two so far. It makes my skin feel soft all day and gives it a nicer look. I wipe the extra on the backs of my hands and I can see they look less wrinkled and softer now.\n",
      "This was recommended by a friend and I absolutely love using it at night before bed. Before starting this product I had dry spots on my face, but now my skin is hydrated and feels so smooth.\n",
      "I'm a bit torn about this product. I absolutely love how it moisturizes my skin - it leaves my skin soft and supple, and fine lines are less visible. Here's the \"but\" - my skin also has started to appear less bright, which I don't like.\n",
      "very smooth\n",
      "i love this product!  great buy for a great product..cheaper than you can find in stores and just as good as other high end creams.  Glad i found!\n",
      "Love this product. When put on a wet face the hyaluronic acid really helps to trap the water molecules on the skin! Since it is winter and my skin is pretty dry I also use my Cerave lotion after this product. Not an absolutely necessary product but I am really enjoying it! Also doesn't seem to irritate my acne prone skin for those who are worried.\n",
      "Great product great price !\n",
      "My most favorite Neutrogena product yet! I camp and boat all summer....it takes a toll on my skin. This has been a life saver this year!\n",
      "I absolutely love the scent of this product! It smells like clean water and reminds me of the scent from Bath and Body Works called Dancing Waters. This moisturizer is a lightweight gel that is not sticky or heavy on your skin. Just a little bit goes a long way. If you have extremely dry skin and are looking for a product with lots of moisture, I would not recommend this product. It lightly moisturizes and is quite refreshing. I highly recommend this product!\n",
      "This product is not fragrance free.  If you get migraines from cosmetic fragrances, do not purchase this product.\n",
      "Great moisturizer\n",
      "My entire life I've had normal/oily skin. I'm 43 years young and have always loved skincare and makeup. I dare say I'm not aging too badly! Ha! That being said ... My skin has been really dry and flaky on my nose and cheeks all winter. I've been flummoxed as to the dramatic skin texture change. Dull, ruddy and tired. So I decided to purchase the “extra” dry Neutrogena Hydro Boost gel cream. I'm astounded. Only five days later and my skin has dramatically changed. I keep looking in the mirror to make sure that what I'm feeling with my fingertips is for REAL. My skin is smooth and hydrated and not a patch of red, dry skin anywhere. I'm a believer. I honestly believe it's taken five years right off of my face. I couldn't be happier! I'm about to order the eye cream and the serum.\n",
      "i will buy it again, makes my skin feel moist\n",
      "This stuff is amazing! I will always buy this lotion for my face as it doesn’t make me break out and is very nourishing and doesn’t feel heavy to apply. Plus it is a good amount and came packaged nicely.\n",
      "I have been using this face hydro blast cream for 2 days and I have to say I have seen dramatic changes in my dry skin. I have been suffering with dry skin and all the repercussions of the summer heat I am having pimples flakes and God knows it's not pretty on my face. however this cream really adds moisture and I have already began to see dramatic changes in the appearance of my skin. I don't know if wearing makeup or the foundation for my makeup has caused a bit of irritation where I am now having some fine pimples and showing in places where my skin is dry very dry and I have bought several other creams that have not helped me where moisture is concerned but this one so far in two days have really helped me and I would highly recommend wish it could be a little cheaper but good things always come in small packages and I have to say for the price and the almost immediate response to my skin it is worth it I highly recommend give it a try.\n",
      "I am very impressed with this stuff.. I have very dry skin in the winter and I have tried so many different creams to hydrate my face.  Everything from high end \"hope in a jar\" to Bath and body works , to Olay... I am 38 and am noitceing some changes in my skin.  I ran out of my Bath and Body Vitamin E lotion so I opted to dry this.. That being said I don’t' like drug store creams I feel they leave my skin greasy or sticky.  Also I find most drug stores  creams don't sit well under a full face of makeup either.  So anyway...... To my surprise I REALLY LIKE THIS STUFF !! very impressed !!! Amazon is by far the cheapest placed to purchase this I bought mine at Walgreens for 17.99 its 11.99 on Amazon...  I will continue to use this until it's gone.. It sits so well under my makeup and sinks into my skin so nice.. I wake up and my face looks so refreshed.. Mind you I bought the dry skin version and YES make sure you have dry skin because this stuff is crazy moisturizing I think they have a oily skin version as well.. Get the right one..\n",
      "Nothing special.  It disappears quickly, leaving no indication that I had just put in on (unlike other moisturizers I've used over the years).  I gave it an extra star because it's unscented.\n",
      "a+\n",
      "I have super dry skin and this has been a game changer. Love it!!\n",
      "I love this moisturizer a lot! Somehow, it seems so much softer than other creams I've used in the past. It leaves my skin feeling refrehed and energized.\n",
      "I love this cream, it goes on so smoothly and makes my face feel so smooth. Definitely a must have item.\n",
      "I just love this.  Makes my skin feel better every time.\n",
      "Non sticky and perfect for my dry skin\n",
      "I initially bought this moisturizer last year because my dermatologist recommended it.  I used to over-pay for those fancier brands that cost triple what this one does, but no more.  This cream feels great - it's light and gets absorbed easily.  And my skin is noticeably softer and less dry since I have been using.\n",
      "I like this \"gel-cream\" a lot.  Not only does it plump up my skin & make fine lines look less noticeable (temporary, of course), it moisturizes really well.  It has no scent, is not greasy/tacky & I get no breakouts from it.  A little bit goes a long way!  I wear this 24/7.  It disappears in to my skin quickly.Even my husband likes this - that is saying something.  He does not tolerate scented products or greasy products.  He recently had a cold & this kept his sore nose moisturized.I am buying this for all my family (female & male) for Christmas.\n",
      "Neutrogena Hydro Boost is nothing short of miraculous. I've never been more pleased with a facial moisturizer. I got it yesterday and used it right away. I was impressed with how smoothly it went on and was completely invisible. Even better, my skin didn't feel tight or coated. Then the miracle:  A couple of hours later, I looked in the mirror, and surprise, no dry, flakey skin. I assumed it just hadn't had time to get back to its dry condition, but this morning it still looks as smooth as it does in the summertime. This is the first time I've used a Neutrogena product, but it certainly won't be the last.\n",
      "A little goes a long way! It is very hydrating and doesn't leave my face feeling greasy.\n",
      "I honestly feel I should receive my money back after using the product. This product doesn't do anything more than water does on your skin. At least with water I know exactly what's in it and it's great for my skin. this product cannot say that. I felt like I was putting and jelly mess on my face. I tried this product out for two weeks and I feel it did more damage to my skin than hydrated. I wouldn't ever get it again or recommend to a friend\n",
      "After using 5-6 jars, I figured I should leave a review! I have combination dry/oily sensitive skin and tried a multitude of moisturizers that did not work well. This provides the perfect amount of moisture without feeling heavy or greasy. Doesn't break me out. Doesn't have any unnecessary scents or frills. Great moisturizer and that's that!\n",
      "I normally don't write reviews but this cream is AMAZING. I thought $17.99 was a bit pricy because normally I but garnier moisture rescue for extra dry skin but it wasn't cutting it and I would have to put on extra and my skin was still dry. this product I only have to put on a tiny bit and it works!!! my skin isn't dry anymore. $17.99 is definitely worth it. would absolutely buy again\n",
      "I love this product and works great for my dry skin.  I have re-purchased so many of these and I have to make sure I don't ever run out.\n",
      "so hydrating!\n",
      "Loveeee doesn't make me brakeout!!!thank u Jesus!highly recommend\n",
      "what is the difference between the gel crean and the water one\n",
      "Awesome product. I got rid of anything else that I was using. My skin feels better and fresh.\n",
      "Makes my face super soft and honestly, I think the lines on my forehead are less prominent.\n",
      "Great cream!\n",
      "I love this stuff. It helps my icky chapped winter skin look somewhat normal and it doesn't cause breakouts. It doesn't have any smell and it goes on almost like a creamy gel vs a lotion. It feels soothing on chapped and dry skin.\n",
      "I really like this product, easy to use and my skin is showing improvement.\n",
      "Not that easy. Trying to get Amazon in the phone\n",
      "I would give this product a 0 if that was an option. Extremely drying!\n",
      "Okay....better than nothing. Not the results I had hoped for.\n",
      "THIS STUFF IS HEAVEN SENT\n",
      "I've been using this for 3 weeks now. I'm 34, fair, with sensitive, oily skin that turns flaky during winter. I wash my face with a black soap bar for sensitive skin (charcoal + olive oil), and an alcohol-free witch hazel toner. Using this as part of my skin care routine has made my skin noticeably smoother and brighter and has not caused any irritation or adverse effects at all. I've been a fan of gel creams since Garnier came out with theirs a few years ago, but their formula just didn't hydrate my skin the way Neutrogena's seems to do.\n",
      "I've used Oil of Olay for so long that the products have reached their plateau. I was skeptical about this whole \"see results in 7 days\" crap that a ton of companies swear by; however, I did see results.My skin looks firmer, younger, and a lot healthier.This doesn't leave your face oily like Oil of Olay products do. Plus there's no obnoxious scent either.\n",
      "This is a miracle in a jar!  It has transformed my flaky itchy skin especially on my forehead into smooth silk.  I am 40 and have rosacea so I cannot just use any moisturizer.  This one has no scent, no oil, no clogging of pores.  I put it on after my shower and my skin sucks it up like a drink it leaves no oily residue or greasy feel you can put your makeup on almost immediately.  Prior to using I was struggling with peeling, flaking, crape paper looking skin especially on my forehead. I could literally flake it off with my fingers.  This corrected it in about 14 days to plump smooth hydrated skin. I use twice a day and some days if I'm home with no makeup I will use three times a day.  It is addictive and fantastic!  I'm going out to buy more now!!\n",
      "I honestly didn't like it after the first use. It doesn't hydrate me at all and it sort of stings on my skin. I've tried using it numerous times and none of them were effective. Would not purchase again.\n",
      "I tried many different brands for my super dry skin but this is the only one that did the job. I've already ordered 2 more. It's kinda pricey but worth it to me. My skin is finally moisturized!\n",
      "I have combination skin and break out easily so finding good facial products can be quite a chore. I'm so glad I decided to give this a try because it does amazing things for my skin without breaking me out at all. No more dry patches and my face gets a lot less oily throughout the day. I'd say it's definitely worth a try if you're on the fence about this moisturizer.\n",
      "OMG. I am a believer. A wonderful product. I wish I found it years ago. It minimizes my fine lines on my forehead and eye areas noticeably after just one night of use. Very well-absorbed, light. You must give it a try and you will be happy that you do.\n",
      "Leaves my skin feeling moisturized, but not greasy. Great price.\n",
      "The sample I received from my dermatologist was much easier to use - in a tube.I couldn't find it anywhere near my home, so I ordered it from Amazon.It came in a jar (l knew this when I ordered it).The product is just as wonderful, but it's much harder to use.I only need to use a drop of the cream for it to work and it is UNSCENTED - which is very important to me. It's not only a preference. It's a medical necessity.\n",
      "The water GEL is my absolute fav! I bought this one on accident which is the gel CREAM which I’m not a huge fan of so far.. but the water gel is absolutely amazing. And smells great!! Super light scent. I think I’ve repurchased this product about 10xs and I’m not one to be stuck on one product.\n",
      "My fave face cream...been using since it first came out!\n",
      "Pretty good product.  It's not great but okay.  It helps keep my makeup on all day.\n",
      "I use this year round!  Love this moisturizer.  It's so smooth and doesn't make my face feel oily.\n",
      "This is a great daytime moisturizer. Leaves no graesy film, and seems to \"settle\" into your skin very quickly.\n",
      "I recommend this product to anybody who has very dry skin but needs a face cream that isn't heavy and blocks pores. Goes on super smooth, smells amazing, and leaves you feeling confident. Will forever use this produce, thank you!!\n",
      "Love it\n",
      "This is now my daily moisturizer as it relieves any dryness I may have. extremely moisturizing and perfect for the winter season.\n",
      "It burns like hell on my face, i have dry sensitive skin and I thought this might calm and keep my face moisturized, but it was a big mistake and i gave it many chances and tried it many times during the year. Never again!\n",
      "Great product!  Makes my skin so smooth and soft and just the right amount of moisture.  Love this.\n",
      "it really softens those fine lines and moisturizes the skin..  I will order more\n",
      "Love this product!  Non greasy and hydrates.\n",
      "Good product\n",
      "I bought this because my skin tends to get very oily by the end of the day.  This is light weight but I feel gives me good moisture. Best of all it doesn't break me out.\n",
      "Lmao downside now I have to buy a new one for myself. Upside it shows this is a greatly versatile product for many ages and skin types. Best moisturizer I have used (and obviously the best my mother has used)Edit: would also like to say its great for evenings after harsh weather exposure. This is ultra lightweight but attracts moisture it makes any moisturizer you put on top work better. This helped revive my skin after I spent an hour shoveling snow.\n",
      "Best moisturizer so far for areas of dry and peeling skin on face.  Not oily, light feel to it.\n",
      "This stuff is like Heaven on my face.. I had really bad facial peeling and this stuff fixed me right up, I even put it on my scalp. I Love this stuff!\n",
      "This is my new go to moisturizer, especially good for Women over 40 with aging dryness!  Love it!\n",
      "Really keeps skin hydrated and dries quickly after applying. A product I will continue to use.\n",
      "I've used another facial moisturizer for years and years but once I started using Neutrogena Extra Dry Hydro Boost I no longer use that brand. My old brand cost twice as much and I honestly cannot see twice the results.  Also, I can order Neutrogena online and have it delivered directly to my door rather than spend my lunch hour or weekends going to department stores where the ladies in white coats try to shame  me into purchasing 10 other products.\n",
      "I bought this because I kept seeing Kristen Bell's beautiful glowing skin.  This is the first thing I've used that didn't give me these gross little white bumps that plague me. I still don't look like Kristen, but my skin is soft and hydrated.  I'm 62 and have no wrinkles.  I hope this keeps me that way.  Highly recommended. It is also less expensive on Amazon than in stores.\n",
      "awsome\n",
      "You can really tell that your skin is more hydrated. You can see and feel the difference.\n",
      "This cream, has now become the love of my life. This cream is amazing. It feels wet on your skin when you apply it, it feels hydrating, and it dries really quickly so you don't feel your face as if you can't breathe. Personally, face creams cannot be too thick. They have to be very light. If you are the same, this is the cream for you. My skin is much clearer, and I looooove this. 100% recommend it. My skin is so soft now. I JUST LOVE THIS.\n",
      "I like the tingle feel and price is right\n",
      "Its ok, not super moisturizing. If I'm having an \"dry\" day (my skin is usually oily) I have to add a thicker more moisturizing face cream on top of this one.\n",
      "it is good for the price. not super moisture but good enough.\n",
      "It dried my skin up really bad. Initially I bought it because it said it would help with dry skin but it didn't.\n",
      "very, very effective for dry, hot weather - better still if you keep it in the fridge\n",
      "Phoebe swears by this stuff.\n",
      "Awesome product. Great hydration . Tried many and prefer this\n",
      "Amazing, love this, 2nd jar. It's light and good for the summer time. ( Gel in the summer ) use cream in the winter ;-) A must buy to try.\n",
      "Amazing. I saw results during a harsh winter, in as little as one week, my skin was soft and no longer flaking. And you barely have to apply any. I'm so glad to have something finally that works for me, even with my egsema!\n",
      "I received a sample of this from Influenster to try out a few months ago. I was really excited to try it out, but after doing some research, I discovered the main ingredient, hyaluronic acid, isn't breastfeeding safe. I was a bit disappointed, but I decided to share it with my Mom instead. Since trying it out, she's loved how it feels! She lives in Chicago, and this has been a great moisturizer for the colder/dryer months that doesn't leave an oily feeling. I believe she would give this 5 stars, but I am giving 4 since it isn't breastfeeding \"safe.\" For full transparency, I had the opportunity to test this product for free, but all opinions are my own.\n",
      "perfect amount of moisture, no greasy after feeling\n",
      "It does soak in quickly, but doesn't really \"hydrate\" like I thought it would.  I was hoping for something better than Cetaphil Cream, but have found cetaphil to be a better hydrating solution.\n",
      "Honestly perfection. No irritation and I have super sensitive skin. Love how it leaves my skin moisturized but not oily.\n",
      "Love love this cream!\n",
      "This is a great product. But like anything else it is not going to be for everyone. I am a big fan of hylauronic acid and I always use product that has some in prior to moisturizing my face. As one reviewer stated it is a great alternative to Cliniques Moisture Surge. So I am in my 50s and my skin is aging and I would describe it as sensitive. I use the cream gel version on my face before my moisturizer, I do not use it in place of a moisturizer. This works really well for me. I would recommend it to anyone. I would also describe it as being gender neutral, that may not be the right terminology to use, but what I am trying to say is that anyone could use it. If you use hylauronic acid, you might want to try this.\n",
      "My skin is SO dry! I use Retin A which makes it even drier so I am always looking for good moisturizers that deeply hydrate my skin. I had been using a very similar cream by AHAVA with a high price tag but I saw this gel cream and decided to see if it was similar to the pricey stuff. It is but it is lighter, more like a day cream for me. This gel cream is very good. I don't use it exclusively but I do use it during  the day before makeup application to hydrate and plump my skin. It smooths on my skin and feels a bit wet which I actually like. It absorbs pretty quickly without pilling or feeling greasy. It hydrates well and leaves my skin very smooth and fresh.It's almost as good as AHAVA's similar gel cream at a fraction of the cost. I use it around my eyes as well with no issues. It isn't the best cream in the world but, for the low price, it is very hydrating and helps to plump fine lines and make skin smooth and fresh. I have it in Subscribe and Save so I always have it on hand. Unfortunately, I found that the eye cream that goes with this Hydro Boost cream to be not so great. This gel cream is actually better around the eyes than the dedicated eye cream. In all, an affordable and good day cream for normal and dry skin.\n",
      "Wish this would work for me! When I first apply it, it feels very nice / soft. After a few hours, my skin is much dryer than before. Great ingredient list, but my skin is extra extra dry and this was simply not enough for it. Also, they should repackage this. The packaging is lovely, but not hygienic.\n",
      "Looking for something that doesn't clog your pores like lotion?  This is a great alternative.  If you have combination skin like I do, then you will never get away from the greasy look 8 hours into the day (unless you wash and reapply of course, but who has time?).  I usually have major breakouts anytime I change facial moisturizers, but this stuff goes on super clean and I never had an issue.  It leaves your skin feeling silky smooth!EDIT - Changed from a 4 star to a 5 star.  This is the ONLY moisturizer I will be using from now on.  My combination skin turned out to be a form of Rosacea, and after visiting a dermatologist, she prescribed me a topical cleanser and recommended I use this moisturizer.  She was thrilled to find out that I already am!  It has Hyaluric (SP?) acid in it, which is an age reducer for skin.  So yeah, keep those wrinkles at bay!\n",
      "I like it very much.  It provides moisture without feeling greasy or heavy.\n",
      "Started to irritate my skin.  Had to stop using it.\n",
      "I started using this moisturizer about a week ago and it has some good points.  The gel cream is great, as it instantly is absorbed into your skin.  Your skin feels wonderful, very moisturized yet not greasy or heavy feeling.  However, when I applied my makeup over this, (foundation, concealer and powder) my skin did not feel great.  Normally I use Neutrogena sensitive skin moisturizer.  This is very light and does not fight with my makeup.  The Hydro Boost seems to make my make up feel heavy.  It also makes my make up hard to apply, as if I am dragging it over my skin.  I also felt I had use more foundation to get the same coverage, which is natural looking normally.  Being 51 years old, I do have wrinkles and generally they aren't overly noticeable or stand out while wearing make up.  This moisturizer seemed to accentuate, accumulate, and settle into the wrinkles I do have, and my make up wound up looking too thick or cakey.  Maybe I used too much moisturizer, it's hard to tell because you don't get that greasy, too much feeling like you would with a cream moisturizer.  It just instantly absorbs, which I guess is good if you don't need to wear any make up. I noticed that it does contain dimethicone.  I see this ingredient in hand moisturizers that claim it will last through a hand washing.  It is sort of a \"mask\" type of thing that prevents moisture loss.  I think that is what makes my make up feel weird.  I feel I would use this moisturizer on days when I don't want to wear makeup, or at night.\n",
      "I wouldn't recommend this for anyone with dry or sensitive skin (I have a tendency towards both). I had heard a lot of good things about this product for a long time, and wanted to give it a try. As the weather gets colder my skin gets really dry, especially so this year, and I found that my normal moisturizer wasn't quite enough, so I finally ordered this product. Pretty disappointed though.I've tried using it a few times since ordering it, and wanted to give it a few honest attempts before making up my mind about it, but I can barely keep it on my face for more than a few minutes without giving into the urge to wash it off. Something about this product really irritates my skin, and my skin actually feels dryer after putting this product on my face.I have some mild eczema on my face from the colder weather (it's not year round, I usually don't have very problematic skin), and this made it worse. This might be a partial cause of my sensitivity to the product.That being said, for people with normal/ oily skin I could see this product working just fine, but it's definitely not for extra dry skin, like the packaging claims.\n",
      "Love the consistency.\n",
      "the product seems good to my skin. It will be better if the outside box was not deformed when it came to my hand. And the jar should be sealed inside.\n",
      "I have combination skin with moderate acne. I am always using a topical to treat it and currently, I am using clindamycin phosphate topical solution. This topical is working well for me but is VERY drying, so I bought this moisturizer as a night cream. I was worried it would leave my skin looking greasy, but it doesn't at all! It's incredible; when you're putting it on, it feels like you're putting a wet gel on and it absorbs very quickly. It feels like a luxurious eye cream (and I use it under my eyes as well) for your whole face. it makes my skin look and feel really smooth and supple without feeling greasy. My only recommendation is to buy the one with SPF if you don't use a sunscreen and plan to use it as a daytime moisturizer. Two thumbs up!\n",
      "works well\n",
      "Ruined my complexion. Dried my skin out after 4or5 applications. Very disappointed. I'm finished with you for good this time neutrogena. You can't bottle youth. Be happy with who you are.\n",
      "As far as I'm concerned you can not go wrong with Neutrogena Products! When I think of the cost of some of the \"prestige\" creams and potions compared to the quality and most of all the results I can't for the life of me imagine why anyone would spent all that money.  That's this girls opinion and I know different products may work different on other people.\n",
      "Helped my dry skin.I love this product i just didn't like that theres only a small amount.I went through the product pretty quick.\n",
      "This makes my skin silky smooth and my fine lines and wrinkles less noticeable!  Great product!\n",
      "I gave 4/5 Stars because this product meets my expectations.A little goes a long way, not pricey. I feel moisturized, and it doesn't leave a film or irritate my eyes. No smell.  I will give 5 Stars if it keeps me hydrated in winter. That will be the real test. Overall, good purchase.\n",
      "Really lovely hydrating gel\n",
      "very emollient.  a tiny bit goes a long way and feels exceptionally moist and smoothe.\n",
      "Really hurt my eyes. If you have sensitive eyes don't use.. After 3 weeks it still did not go away.\n",
      "Due to chemotherapy, I have had really dry skin this year. My wife picked this up at CVS, and insisted I use it. I have to say it works! My dry skin on my face went away pretty quickly. It also is not greasy at all, which I really appreciate. It also has no oder to it. Definitely recommend. It's also cheaper to buy on Amazon than CVS.\n",
      "I love this stuff. It doesn't irritate my skin or clog my pores like so many other creams I have tried. This has made it into my everyday routine and will stay there. I get the eye gel too.\n",
      "This is the best yet! I love the texture, the way it leaves my skin feeling revived, and even how fresh the smell is. This is a great product and it got to me extremely fast!\n",
      "This was recommended by Kristen Belle in an article and I decided to try it. I love it. My skin feels really soft and moisturized.\n",
      "So good!\n",
      "This product is great. I have combination skin that gets dry in the winter, and I'd been using Clinique's version of this for a few months before I found Neutrogena's version. Hydro Boost was in my recommended products list and at roughly half the price I decided to try- this is basically the same product as the more expensive version. I use it at night (two layers, after toner and serum), and it leaves my skin smooth and hydrated in the morning. Very lightweight and absorbs easily. This is now a staple in my skin care routine!\n",
      "This is very nice. It leaves my skin feeling very soft and silky.\n",
      "This stuff is great. I also use Clinique's version (in the little pink tub) which I also love, but this is definitely comparable and just as good imo. I have very dry skin, and I use this every time I wash my face. Love it.\n",
      "Loved how it felt so cool on the skin not heavy, greasy feeling.\n",
      "The only cream that really helps my dry flaky skin!\n",
      "This moisturizer is nice.  It goes on well without a greasy or oily film.  It is a great everyday moisturizer.  It doesn't work well with extremely dry skin.  I travel for work and my skin will still dry out.  I still recommend it for everyday use.\n",
      "I have extremely sensitive skin that breaks out at the drop of a hat and gets super super dry as soon as the weather even thinks about getting cold. When it's dry it flakes and peels off in layers and cracks and gets so uncomfortable. I have tried so many lotions and most are either ineffective at moisturizing, don't last long, are greasy, or clog my pores like nobody's business. This is an amazing product! My skin absorbs it quickly like it drinks it, it makes my skin feel comfortable and smooth and it lasts all day. AND it has not caused my to break out! On the contrary, by keeping my skin healthy and hydrated I feel like it has helped my acne. Thank goodness I have this on my side for the cold winter weather. This does not clog my pores, wears well under makeup, is not greasy, and lasts all day. I do use it in conjunction with the hydroboost serum as a prep.\n",
      "This is NOT like Neutrogena gel you buy at the store. It's more of a white lotion than a blue gel. Just be forewarned. Does not work as well.\n",
      "nice  not oily\n",
      "great hydration, face feels refreshed\n",
      "\"Neutrogena Hydro Boost Gel Cream, Extra Dry\" is literally the answer to my prayers!!I am 71 years old and recently my face etc. had sadly gotten extremely dry and my wrinkles much more visible. I had tried many other remedies with no appreciable results except my wallet becoming much lighter. This product showed a difference in hours and solved all my problems in a few days. I hope they never stop making it!! (Neutrogena, Are you listening??) I wish it was offered in a larger container as I have found that it also works beautifully on my hands so I have been using a little more each day.On top of working so nicely it is relatively inexpensive and I love the jar. Try it I am sure you will like it!\n",
      "Feels like department store product.\n",
      "We reorder this every summer and maybe 1 or 2 packs is all my wife need a through the whole summer! She loved it. She has tried many other products to try to replace this but not worth it.\n",
      "Fantastic!!! A little bit makes all the difference for you face, TRY IT ONCE, YOU'LL TRY IT AGAIN! :-)\n",
      "Neutrogena Hydro Boost Gel-Cream, Extra-Dry Skin, 1.7 OzLove this water gel.  I use it to hydrate my combination skin and I have purchased it several times now.  I like it so much I just featured it in my 2016 Yearly Favorites video on my YouTube Channel at Nowlific.This is the Neutrogena Hydro Boost Water Gel, 1.7 Fl. oz that I purchased here on Amazon.PROS:*Easy to use right out of the box*Comfortable to wear*Sinks in quickly*Calms down the dry areas of my face immediately*Doesn’t clog my pores*Isn’t greasy*Makeup sits quite nicely over itCONS:*I feel like I go through the jar quickly, perhaps I am using too much of the product at once because I like it so much.Overall, I am very happy with this water gel and feel that it is good quality. My only suggestion would be for Neutrogena to make larger size options available.\n",
      "Love this for my face!!!!\n",
      "GREAT PRODUCT, FEELS WONDERFUL, NOT GREASY AND EASILY ABSORBED, AND YOUR FACE FEELS SILKY SOFT THE ENTIRE DAY.\n",
      "Great value and product.\n",
      "I have been using it for a week now and it's amazing!  I love the feel of this gel-cream it's so smooth and light.  I have extremely dry, sensitive skin, eczema and allergies so it is very hard to find products that work for me.  The skin around my eyes have been very dry, with the skin flaking and cracking and using this twice a day it's almost gone!  I can't wait to see how my skin looks and feels down the road.  I have tried the more expensive products that don't even come close to the results that hydro boost does.\n",
      "great product\n",
      "Tried it for half a year, works perfectly with my oily skin. Thanks to this product, I have been able to go through the dry stage after Differin gel and Accutane. I now introduce it to my brother who has acne and my sister who has very dry skin. So I bought 10pcs at one time. A bit crazy.\n",
      "Just heard about this product.  It is light, not greasy, and helps with dry skin a lot.I use it a.m. and p.m.  works well.\n",
      "I love this and feel it is just as effective as Clinique’s Moisture Surge!\n",
      "I suffer from psoriasis and very dry skin on my face. When I applied to the skin it felt like a cool splash of water and one application lasted me all day. =D. I highly recommend this product.\n",
      "I wasn't that impressed at all, especially for the price.\n",
      "perfect - doesn't feel greasy- super light scent and lasts on my face! I use year round. tried the standard formula in the summer but its a gel and def sticky comparatively.\n",
      "I was really excited to try this gel due to the base being hydraloronic acid and water. But it turns out the amount of active ingredients is too low for it to be effective and the other stuff is not anything to write home about. The fragrance is really strong for a facial moisturizer. U can probably just rub it on your wrist as perfume and leave it at that.\n",
      "Probably the best moisterizer I've ever used. I use it primarily at night and I love it!\n",
      "This is the best mosturizing cream I've ever use! After using it literally my skin becomes very soft like a baby face! It's better than Clinique moisture intense, Dr Jart hydro water and many other different gel creams I have( even they are more pricey than this one).\n",
      "I use it daily, I don't know if it does anything but it doesn't hurt.\n",
      "I didn't find this special in anyway.  But, my mother loves it and feels that it really hydrates her skin -- so I gave the jar to her!  I think I just prefer a thicker, creamy type of moisturizer. (like olay regenerist)\n",
      "This is a personal thing with me and I'm sure Neutrogena has a good product, like always.  However, the FEEL.Yuk!  I did not like the feel of the Gel on my face.  Felt almost suffocating and slimy.  I wear very little make-up, zero foundation, so having this thick paste on my face was not how I naturally like to be. I've since moved on the Chia (seed) Oil, much nicer, but can stain clothing.\n",
      "I've been using this for the past few weeks and I must say: I love this gel-cream. It says for extra dry skin and trust when I say I have extra dry skin, especially during the winter. Suffice it to say that my whole face, pretty much, gets dry and crusty, especially the forehead and chin areas. My skin gets so dry that in some parts, particularly the corners of my nose, that it peels, itches, and burns; ever since I started using this gel-cream I've noticed a huge difference, even from the first time I used it. It keeps my face soft and moisturized the entire day. It even takes away the shine my forehead tends to get after I wash it. Every. Time. It's also very gentle on my sensitive skin; not one breakout from using it. I highly recommend it.\n",
      "Excellent gel moisturizer! It is like soaking your face in water\n",
      "Perfect\n",
      "Love this moisturizer!!\n",
      "This is a great cream which boosts the moisture of my face.The skin looks fresh all day long .It is an important part of my daily routine because the dry air indoors and windy conditions outdoors really was making my skin dry and thus tired looking. This was the cream I was looking for and it has not disappointed me. I use it before applying sunblock moisturizer and that gives me dual benefits.\n",
      "I'm in my mid 30s and have Seborrheic Dermatitis on my face.  When I was younger, I had very oily skin.  Now that I'm older my skin is more combination.  This gel moisturizer was recommended to me by my Dermatologist and I love it so much!This product is lightweight, extremely moisturizing and soaks into your skin in a matter of seconds.  I've even put it on my elbows if I see they're getting a little rough.Don't forget that this stuff is OIL FREE, FRAGRANCE FREE, DYE FREE, NON COMEDOGENIC and has HYALURONIC ACID in it!!!It's hard to believe this is by Neutrogena and so affordable!I got the one for extra dry skin, but this would work exceptionally on oily skin too!!! (Mine is combination)\n",
      "I feel like gel although a little tacky helps make foundation looks smoother on face\n",
      "feels good when you first put it on, but in the morning face became very dry\n",
      "Love this stuff. Fixes dry skin instantly.\n",
      "Goes on light , not greasy and doesn't have an overpowering smell! Really love this stuff!!\n",
      "Love it\n",
      "I like it....skin feels moist, not greasey.\n",
      "Thanks for the quick shipping. Item as described. Picture as described. Great product! Would purchase from again!\n",
      "I regularly use Neuterogena Products and this does what it says. One of the best products I have used.  Hydrates the skin with no sticky feel.\n",
      "I first received a sample of this from my dermatologist and I really liked it. It has a really fresh scent and makes my skin feel really soft. I'm 50 so clearly this isn't going to reverse any skin damage or miraculously take away my wrinkles and I'm not even gonna try to persuade you of that but I will say this...I like it and I think does a good job as a moisturizer. I honestly feel it does as good of a job as other over priced items that do the same old thing. A little bit goes a long way. The gel in it really makes putting this on your face easy and it spreads really well and I feel like it's still there and doing its job hours later, unlike some moisturizers you put on and your face feels dry as dirt 30 minutes later. FYI- I did NOT receive any discount or get this item free for my review.\n",
      "I give this 3 stars because the price is so high. It does a very good job on my dry skin, but I won't buy buy again.\n",
      "One of better creams out there for the price. It hydatates well. Have it 4 stars sincw expected a little more boost genes the name of the product t.\n",
      "I've tried many products... including some high priced creams. I suffer with rosacea and dry skin... so dry in fact that sometimes I felt like I have facial dandruff. My skin is very sensitive as well. Using this product morning and night has not helped with the redness ( I've given up hope on that problem)but my facial dryness is much improved.I don't write reviews often... but somewhere out there... someone suffers with the same problem I have... and perhaps this cream can help them.\n",
      "I was enjoying this product until I learned that they test on animals. Will never buy again.\n",
      "Best moisturizer I have ever used.\n",
      "I use this almost daily (alternate with sunblock as applicable). Great product.\n",
      "Love this moisturizer! It's very light, spreads evenly and moisturizes beautifully. Continued use of this product is a certainty.\n",
      "After having used Clinique Moisture Surge for several years, I wanted to try this as a similar alternative.  It feels really good going on but didn't feel like it stayed hydrated for as long as I'd hoped.  I really wanted to love this product (because I love Neutrogena products so much!), but it just couldn't stand up to Clinique's Moisture Surge.  It would be a very good alternative, tho, if you are looking for a moisturizer that isn't as cost prohibitive as Clinique.\n",
      "This moisturizer is amazing! I was on the hunt for a moisturizer like the Keihl's one I love that wasn't $30. I'm so happy I found this, and my skin is happy too!\n",
      "I was recommended this product and it seemed to really be high quality plus you get ao little for such a high price. After only 2 applications my face was red and started peeling in a rash. I would not recommend if you have even the slightest bit of sensistive skin. My face burned for days and i immediately stopped usage. I can't see the option to return but I want to\n",
      "I usually never see results from creams however I used this on my neck where I have deep wrinkles from sun damage.. I’m amazed that they have improved, I would say by at least 20%. Which I think is amazing. Highly recommend!\n",
      "Great stuff!\n",
      "Love it.\n",
      "wonderful\n",
      "I didn't like the way this felt on my face. It is not greasy, but it felt somewhat mask-like and I was afraid it would clog my pores. I am using it as hand cream so it doesn't go to waste - it does make my hands feel nice and smooth! I would not buy this again.\n",
      "My skin is combination/oily, and breaks out easily. Still I always have trouble with dry skin in the winter, especially on my chin. This has really helped solve that problem! It has not caused breakouts so far.\n",
      "Love this moisturizer and couldn believe I could buy it for almost half the drugstore price, what a deal !\n",
      "The price is double what I pay at my local Job Lot, but they were out and I love the product.  Nothing else does quite what this product does, even the products with big company names..\n",
      "I've been using this for a few months now and I honestly love it. I have dry skin and it has worked so well for me, I'm also acne prone and it doesn't clog my pores.\n",
      "I love this moisturizer! It goes on so light and is so refreshing. After just a few uses, my skin is already feeling and looking better\n",
      "Oh my gosh! I would bath in this stuff if I had enough of it! It feels SO wonderful! It's not at all greasy, it just soaks right in and stays there! I want a body version of it RIGHT NOW! I live in the desert. This will keep me moisturized for almost the entire day! I put it on at night also after I've washed off my make up.\n",
      "Gives my skin the boost it needs.  I have sensitive skin and this does not irritate it.\n",
      "Does NOT seem to keep any moisture in. Not a good moisturizer. Disappointed in Neutragena.\n",
      "Good!\n",
      "Good Product .\n",
      "Horrible. Clogged my pores and made me break out in 1 use. Definitely NOT noncomodogenic as it says - one of the first ingredients is dimethicone, an ingredient found in most hair conditioners.\n",
      "I have VERY dry, SENSITIVE skin.  This is a great product, and was delivered very quickly. Thank you!\n",
      "My winter skin is bad.  It's dry, dull, and red.  I was really hoping that Neutrogena's Hydro Boost Gel-Cream could help soothe my parched skin, but unfortunately it didn't live up to the hype.  It's a decent moisturizer.  It smells nice and it's lightweight.  It absorbs into the skin quickly.  I was expecting dramatic results, but I honestly think straight coconut oil does a better job softening and moisturizing my face.  The container is a pretty blue plastic, but it's so thick that it makes you think you're getting more product than what is actually inside.  In reality, 1.7 oz of moisturizer isn't that much.  I imagine it will last 3 or 4 weeks.  I don't think I will purchase again because the price is too high for the quantity and quality of the product.\n",
      "used before\n",
      "I love that it is gel because it feels so light on your skin but has the moisture that makes your skin glow. Even feels more comfortable and like it lasts longer than some that I’ve tested at Sephora!! This facial moisturizer has earned my loyalty!\n",
      "Neutrogena tests their chemicals on animals. Their eyes, their skin, etc., putting the bunnies through prolonged torture. I think that not too many people know this. DO NOT BUY Neutrogena products until they change their testing methods. It's not necessary to test on animals and most companies do not do it. If you have a conscience, don't do it. There are plenty of other products out there that are just as good.\n",
      "The only product I've actually stuck with and was using everyday for dry skin. Well low and behold about 4 werks later I noticed my under eye wrinkles and puffiness was much less noticeable.\n",
      "Woks really well on my dry skin\n",
      "I've never in my life gone through a skin care product so fast, this stuff is absolutely amazing. Perfect for almost all skin types, except if extra sensitive to chemicals, as of course it does contain them. Otherwise, it is an extremely versatile and essential skin product to have in your routine. It's a little bit of a night cream, mixed with a serum and/or everyday moisturizer. If you have combination skin, this is for you. When it's dry and cold it hydrates like crazy, and when it's hot and your skin is oily it just seems to refresh and replenish your skin. Simply amazing! No breakouts or oily skin, only wish it was 100% natural.\n",
      "I'll keep using my other mosturizer\n",
      "I have very oily skin, but also very dry in the winter.  Hydro Boost has helped keep my skin, well, hydrated.  No cracking or flaking yet this winter.\n",
      "Sooo hydrating and it feels amazing on my face! I have super dry cheeks, forehead, and the tip of my nose, but I apply it all over my face for a super hydrated feeling. Don't need to apply too much either. It's cool to the skin and this one has no fragrances or anything my sensitive skin might be allergic to. I love it!\n",
      "This product does not do what it  claims. There was no hydration. I would not buy it again.\n",
      "Haven't noticed a difference after using this product at all. Is refreshing to use, but that's about it.\n",
      "truly not hydrating!  i am so disappointed with this product, I had such high expectations for it.  it burns my face when i apply it...just not a good product at all.\n",
      "On second night of use, woke up to itchy red pimply bumps. Beyond disappointed and painful. I assumed fragrance free and ingredients were in check, but I guess NOT.\n",
      "This product feels wonderful going on. It was recommended by my dermatologist.\n",
      "I am very pleased with this moisturizer & will definitely order/purchase again.  My skin feels better.\n",
      "Really does keep your face well hydrated, eliminates any feeling of tightness, best used with a hydrating \"mist\". Great under makeup.\n",
      "I have been using this lotion for over a year now, and I highly recommend it. My dermatologist gave me samples of it before it was available in stores, and she told me it is the best there is. This was before hyaluronic acid became a \"fad,\" and I still stick with this moisturizer even with so many others on the market. I use it after washing my face with a neutral cleanser and electric facial brush, and after applying serums in the morning and at night. This moisturizer feels refreshing on my skin, and I notice that my skin is plump and bright after using it. Also, this is definitely more of a moisturizer than the regular Hydro-Boost gel. I only use the Extra-Dry version because you don't need another moisturizer with it. Great skincare staple!\n",
      "This hasn't help more then lotion that costs half as much. Save your money.\n",
      "I live in a very dry climate and this stuff has help keep my skin moisturizer without feeling heavy.\n",
      "best moisturizer till date. its a gel based formula and goes good with almost all foundations i use\n",
      "I have very sensitive skin, so I'm always concerned when I try a new product. But I live in a dry climate and needed something just like this. I was completely surprised how well it works - noticeable difference in skin texture and fine lines. Doesn't have a heavy scent and two weeks in, no skin allergy issues. Will buy it again.\n",
      "my skin has been very dry from this winter and I just started using this and it goes on wonderfully and absorbs nicely so you can apply makeup/foundation minutes after applying the lotion. I am very happy I purchased it.\n",
      "Only moisturizer I use. I have dry skin but also suffer from acne. I mix this product with my extremely drying acne cream and it works perfectly. The fact that I use such drying products but still have extremely soft, moisturized skin from using this product is such a testament in itself about how well this cares for the skin.\n",
      "I am not one to write a review or one who is super  into skincare. But I was so impressed by this product that I felt compelled to. I was searching for a facial moisturizer after a bad sunburn left my face very dry. I cannot get over how amazing this product is. It has made my prone-to-dry face soft as a baby's butt. Cannot recommend this product enough! And the price you can't beat!!\n",
      "This hydroboost for dry skin is sooooo much better than the other, lighter, hydroboost formulation. It effectively hydrates and plumps skin without feeling heavy and without causing acne flares!  Hyaluronic acid binds 1000 x its weight in water, making it super effective at hydrating the skin and (temporarily!) minimizes appearance of fine lines/wrinkles. Dry skin definitely gives the illusion of more obvious wrinkles, so proper skin hydration is key. Couple this product with topical antioxidants, topical retinoids & daily sunscreen and you should have some fantastic looking skin! PS some Neutrogena products, in my opinion, have fairly offensive fragrances... This one does NOT! 🙌\n",
      "it gave me a rash\n",
      "I like the way it makes my under eye skin feel. I wear it over my makeup and it helps reduce puffiness. It has a fresh cool feeling.\n",
      "Love this stuff. Helps so much with my dry skin!\n",
      "I used this product and thought it was okay. I had heard great things from friends about this moisturizer. When it ran out, I purchased another container from a local retailer and it was A COMPLETELY different product than the one I purchased on Amazon originally. Because I had never tried this product before, I didn’t know there was anything wrong. My advice...don’t buy any or skin care or beauty products off Amazon. I know I won’t be any longer.\n",
      "excellent\n",
      "I have been searching for a solution for my extremely dry skin for years. Everything I've tried either didn't moisturize well or caused me to break out or both. This winter has been particularly bad for my skin, causing me to have dry patches and flaking skin. I use this Hydro Boost Gel-Cream at night. I first apply Neutrogena Rapid Tone Repair Dark Spot Corrector. Then I apply this gel-cream. I put a generous amount on my fingertips and gently rub it in. (On days that my skin is extra dry, I add a layer of Bio Oil after this cream.) I use Neutrogena Hydro Boost Water Gel SPF 15 in the morning. I've tried so many creams and lotions over the years, including higher end lotions. This is the only thing that fully moisturizes my skin and does not cause me to break out.\n",
      "Love the way it feels on my face like a drink of water to my skin\n",
      "I love this more than expensive ones.This time of the year, my skin gets very dry.Also the mineral powder makes my skin dry.This moisturizer is great and I no longer see the flakes on my skin.\n",
      "a little expensive for the amount you get. but this product is worth every penny.\n",
      "Excellent product and price.  I live where it is hot and dry, so I use this and coconut oil, alternately, morning and night.  Makes a huge difference.\n",
      "My favorite cream! It's good for my dry skin.\n",
      "I like this product very much and have been using it for years. I use it after washing my face in the morning and my skin feels hydrated.\n",
      "Hydrates my skin very nicely. Especially good for summer days. It is not greasy or heave. love it\n",
      "nice on skin\n",
      "I've been using HydroBoost for quite a while now, but when I saw this new formula for extra dry skin, I decided to order it.  It is even more wonderful than the original!  I looked in stores for it after I saw it on Amazon, but did not see it - so I'm glad Amazon introduced this to me.  I'll be buying it again when this one runs out!\n",
      "The cosmetic surgeon at your fingertips. It last all day and is worth purchasing again. I've been an avid Neutrogena user for many years and have used its daytime and nighttime retinol creams and have found that they work in combination, too.\n",
      "I'm pleased with this product.  I have super sensitive skin and break out over everything, but not with this gel cream.  My skin drinks it up with zero irritation. I'm so happy with it that I added in to my Amazon auto-delivery schedule.\n",
      "This is a really nice moisturizer. It absorbs easily into the skin and is moisturizing without being heavy or greasy.\n",
      "Felt weird.\n",
      "This product works wonders for your face. I moved fram for home and the environment destroyed my face. So so dry, it was flaking, like a snake shedding their skin. I tried expensive and well known products that barely did anything.Less than a week after receiving this product, using it 3 times a day the first 2-3 days and then twice a day for 3 days and my faces is almost BACK TO NORMAL.Highly recommend it.\n",
      "I was in desperate need of a new face moisturizer and saw this product had amazing reviews. I have extremely dry, somewhat sensitive skin and thought this gel-cream would be perfect for me. My first impression was that it definitely moisturizing and silky. Later on that evening, I developed a rash all over my mouth and chin area! I have never developed a rash from any product. I really hoped the best for it, but it just isn't for me.\n",
      "This is a great moisturizer. Leaves my skin smooth and feeling fresh. Not heavy or oily.\n",
      "Love this item..its light on my face but moisturized. I have really dry skin and my face feels soft and smooth. I would definitely recommend this product. Excellent price for a good amount of product.\n",
      "Was not thrilled with this moisturizer.  Far too greasy and didn't feel as though it really did anything noticeably positive for my skin.  Sad the return window is closed and now I'll just be throwing it away.\n",
      "My go-to moisturizer.\n",
      "This is what I have been looking for my entire life!!! Finally my face is soft and not so dang dry!!!\n",
      "Hyaluronic avid can hold up to 1000x more moisture than water. That being said, if your skin is in need of hydration, look no further. This is great for a night cream and leaves skin looking dewy and feeling quenched without being heavy and clogging.\n",
      "I have highly sensitive skin!  I haven't been able to wear makeup in years because it causes me to break out.  I used to be an avid Oil of Olay user, but reached a point where even that made my face angry.  I wash my face in water only and it still flakes and scales.  I had been able to use coconut oil with some success for cleaning my face, but it soaks in so fast that the moisturizing effect only lasts a little while.  Needless to say, I was highly skeptical of this product since I had tried them all!My face has never looked or felt better!  I apply it after my shower in the morning and my cheeks and my parentheses around my mouth no longer feel tight and itchy. I wash my face before bed and apply again.  I'm on my second jar and most of my skin issues have went away.  This stuff is seriously a miracle in a jar.\n",
      "First off, pay attention to which one you buy -- there are two and the gel-cream is fragrance-free, while the other is not. This is important for people like me who have extremely sensitive skin. I cannot use products with fragrance. The gel-cream is great. It goes on so smoothly; I love the texture. It absorbs quickly and makes my face feel great. I would point out that I've found it cheaper at local stores. I also seem to be going through it much faster than other facial lotions. But it feels light and non-greasy so I think it will be perfect for a summer morning moisturizer. For super cold, winter weather, I may switch back to my heavier creams.\n",
      "This is the best moisturizer I have ever used. It doesn't contain chemicals like DMDM or urea which is used to make creams soften skin. Those chemicals causes an allergic reaction that causes my hair to fall out.  Read labels and be careful what you use on your face that may affect your hair follicles.\n",
      "One of the only products that helps my skin.  I am allergic to so many ingredients.\n",
      "Very disappointing ! I was just so unhappy with this product 17.69 and not even helping my dry facial skin . I have used Neutrogena for many years so I am just boggled . Not everything works on everyone and this is one of those times. I will still use NEUTROGENA products just not this ..gg\n",
      "The best hydrator I have ever tried.  Makes your skin feel like satin or silk.\n",
      "very nice!\n",
      "Does not feel greasy on my skin. It moisturizes very well. A dermatologist recommended this to me and I’m pleased with it.\n",
      "Does it's job\n",
      "Good stuff but very expensive.\n",
      "This is a dupe for Clinique Moisture Surge, but it's half the price. I have had a little bit of a problem with acne with this if I put make-up over it, but it has cured my dry skin.....so I still really like it. It has the texture of make-up primer, like it has silicone in it.\n",
      "My face is very dry, but I just didn't like the feel of this on my face, maybe it won't effect other buyers, but I have a very sensitive facial skin.\n",
      "This product is a great drugstore option for dehydrated skin. I can really feel it soaking in quickly and locking in the moisture. The extra dry skin cream has no scent at all and is not blue like the water gel is.\n",
      "This product contains Hyaluronic acid, which is normally found in products that are much more expensive. I love this stuff. It makes my skin smooth and soft. I even use it on my hands. I wish I'd had this product 20 years ago ... le sigh.\n",
      "A great non-greasy moisturizer. It plumped up my skin. I love it!\n",
      "Keeps my face moisturized without feeling greasy.  Appears to plump up my skin so the fine lines are not so noticeable.\n",
      "Wonderful, light moisturizer. Glides on and is absorbed super fast. No overpowering fragrance, either.\n",
      "This is the only moisturizer I've tried that actually helped my very dry skin (a big problem in Colorado) and maybe it's my imagination but I think my skin looks more supple and younger.  I love this stuff.\n",
      "Feels fantastic, goes on easily.\n",
      "Best hydration cream out\n",
      "Could be more hydrating. Not sure I would necessarily rate his as for \"very dry\" skin.\n",
      "But something in this cream gives me an allergic reaction :( it stings then causes itching and hives. Too bad, it is really hydrating. Sensitive, eczema prone skin.\n",
      "I have been using this brand for years but a different day dream with spf. I decided to save time and energy and stock up via amazon but the day cream I normally buy from Neutrogena had maybe 3 stars. So I figured I would go with one that had better reviews and pay a couple bucks more.I have really dry skin and my skin is screaming for moisturizer the second I get out of the shower. The reviews made it sound like this would be the best cream for that. Well I tried it and my skin is still thirsty. It took two coats to really make my face feel better and not super taut from dryness.I'm gonna stick with the other neutrogena day cream- reviews aren't as good but not only did it moisturizer better but has a SPF of 20.\n",
      "Took a while to get used to and I had to figure out when to use this. I like to use this after I take a shower or wash my face with a cleanser, then put another moisturizer on top. It adds the extra moisture I need to balance out my dried out skin. The only thing I don't like about this, is the smell and sticky feel when it's on my skin alone.\n",
      "I am so in love with this product! Makes my skin feel so soft and smooth. Goes on very easily and doesn't leave already feeling at all!!! I'm hooked! My skin has never felt better! I was given this product by Influenster for testing purposes but all opinions are my own! :)\n",
      "Good for the price\n",
      "I really wanted to love this product but I don't.  I have dry combo skin and I wanted something light weight for the summer, during the daytime, under foundation.  This formulation is not new, I've seen this in Asia before, this gel sort of texture moisturizer.  The problem with this is that it doesn't hydrate well enough.  It is lightweight and non sticky, but if your skin is super dry, this really is not thick enough to moisturize.  I have issues with it being too thin for use during the summer if I'm indoors in A/C all day.  It might be okay during summer if I'm outside.  Definitely won't use it during the winter.Update: I have been having eye skin irritation since using this product.  I stopped using this product and the irritation went away.  I used it again and my eyes are so itchy, blurry and uncomfortable.  I trusted this product because it is Neutrogena.  But just because it's dye and fragrance free doesn't mean it's hypo allergic.\n",
      "Good drugstore moisturizer.  I was using Clinique moisture surge/hyaluronic.  I loved it but wanted to try this drugstore option.Neutrogena's hydrogel comes in a similar screw top pot.  Some people don't like dipping their hands in product pakaged that way so beware if that concerns you.The product is slightly less emollient than the clinique moisture surge.  However it is far richer than many other drugstore moisturizers I've tried.  It also doesn't seem to have the same occlusive properties as moisture surge.  It has some occlusiveness, but the effect dissipates quickly.Neutrogena keeps my dry winter skin moisturized for a few hours but by the end of the day it looks and feels dry.  It's noticeable under makeup how quickly it fades.  The moisture surge, on the other hand, does not have this problem.  I suspect Neutrogena will work well come summer and oilier daily skin.  Some days ckinique can be too moisturizing on normal summer skin.I would recommend the Neutrogena and suspect it would work exceptionally well with chemical sunscreens on top.  (My skin is sensitive to Avobenzone therefore I use mineral sunscreens which are persnickity with moisturizers.)All in all it's a great utility moisturizer.  Fragrance free and hasn't irritated my skin.\n",
      "Right after applying the cream and tapping on my face so that it can absorb better, I don't feel any moisture. It is like alcohol vaporizing immediately. Worse than Aveeno that I'm using. FYI, I'm an Asian in the 20s. Maybe demographics factor can be a reason why this product is not for me.\n",
      "I just opened this.  Whoever packaged this took out the hydroboost and put in something like hair gel.It's sticky and the fumes burn your eyesI've used hydro boost in the past.  This is not itThe site made me give it a star....\n",
      "Good product\n",
      "Helps with my extra dry skin. Skin feels hydrated and supple. On my second jar. Tried many others but rhis one works!\n",
      "I buy 3-4 jars at a time and always have this on hand. Works as good as really expensive stuff at Nordstrom and doesn't make my face break out.\n",
      "My favorite facial lotion! Moisturizes all day! Or at least it seems like it!\n",
      "I finally found a moisturizer I like.  The feel and texture are smooth and hydrating and I'm beginning to see a difference in my face.  Love this stuff.\n",
      "This is my 3rd jar!  My skin is dehydrated and this really helps rehydrate my skin. Nice light fragrance and it doesn't bother my allergies.\n",
      "so far so good update to follow amazon prime is the way to go\n",
      "Only moisturizer that doesn't make me oily but still provides great hydration for my skin!\n",
      "I never ever write reviews, but I have tried so many creams, including really expensive ones, and this is much better than anything else I have tried.I love the consistency, it absorbs quickly, no unpleasant smell, and I feel like my skin is much better moisturized. I saw a difference in my skin in just a few days.I encourage you to try it.\n",
      "the Neutrogena Hydro Gel. I was, as always a little skeptical of products like this. I have the typical T-zone type of skin, so I don't like slathering moisturiser all over my face because it tends to feel like too much gunk on my face, and never completely soaks in. And the last thing I want on a hot Summer day is a face as shiny as a new penny. This product promises that it is light, and soak in quickly- your perfect Summer moisturiser. I have tried it for 2 weeks now, off an on, and I do like it. I feel like at night, it's perfect. For the morning, I use a moisturizer with SPF, so I had been in the market for a lighter one for nighttime. I checked prices in my local stores, and it's a tad expensive for the amount you get, $29 for the bottle. At least, pricey for me, but I did check and it's cheaper online, so I may have to order from there.  I have yet to check the ingredients on Ewg.org- Skindeep to see exactly what it is I'm putting on my face, but I think if that checks out, this is my new summer moisturizer!\n",
      "I like this cream. Samples were given to me by my dermatologist and I really liked its smooth, clean feel when I used it. I gave it 4 stars because I don't really know that it changed my skin at all. But I will continue using it!\n",
      "I am 62 and have horrible dry skin, plus rosacea. This gel cream is the only thing that works for me. Not greasy at all. Sinks right in and somehow makes all the really dry rough patches look and feel much better.\n",
      "This moisturizer is PERFECT! I got mine at the drug store, but just wanted to leave some feedback on the product. I recently started using two different topical creams for adult acne that make my face so dry. Cerave moisturizer wasn't enough. This has changed my skin! I can put on my topicals and apply this and my face doesn't get flaky and dry, like it was! Try this if you are having extreme dryness. Smells nice and face looks radiant after applying! Will buy this forever!!!\n",
      "This is the best and feels great over your skin if you have a dry skin.\n",
      "I have being using the regular gel for about 3 months now, I recommend using it over night if you wear make up in the day for better results. It absorbs really fast, my skin feels smooth & moisture every morning +I haven't got any pimples ! I'm loving it so far, if you want to save a few bucks you can buy it @ local Walmart for cheaper :)\n",
      "Nice lightweight option for daily use that doesn't leave a heavy/oily look. In my case I need to use a heavy moisturizer at night.\n",
      "Love this product, the perfect moisturizer...great foundation for primer and foundation. Alert: Make sure you get the GEL CREAM...the gel only has fragrance and Blue dye 1. Packaging is almost identical. I made that mistake today and it's awful.\n",
      "Great moisturizer.\n",
      "love this go to gel & is Great for tired skin that needs a bit of Moisture & Boost!\n",
      "For the past few years, I have tried lotions and creams on my face because I am getting older. I had very few wrinkles (if any) when I was in my early 50's) but, now my skin had becaome so dry and creepy looking that I decided to give this a try and it seems to be doing the job! Rarely do you see a real product that can work on older skin, but this DOES work and I will continue to use this product from now on! And, it doesn't break the bank!!\n",
      "This is a nice gel moisturizer, even in the winter my skin did not feel dry. If you have extra dry skin there is a cream gel formula. I have used it for 2 years now and it keeps my 56 year old skin nice a soft.\n",
      "If you’ve never tried this, do yourself a favor and try it. It’s made with hyaluronic acid which is an ingredient in skin care, eye drops and joint medicine bc it helps bring moisture to the actual cells themselves. It’s a really unique texture, more of a gel than a lotion but it dries quickly and doesn’t feel oily or greasy at all. I don’t really like lotion and I love this. I have dry skin and this makes it perfectly moisturized for a long time but doesn’t feel like it would be too much on normal or slightly oily skin. You only need to put on a very tiny amount so even though this jar is somewhat small, it lasts a long time. I only use it every other day and it’s made my skin feel flawless.\n",
      "I love this moisturizer. To me it's a dupe for the Clinique moisture surge. I love how it is hydrating but still lightweight and breathable. I have very dry and sensitive skin and this works great. I always hated the feeling of most moisturizers like I have so much product on my skin but this is so amazing it makes me feel clean and really moisturized.\n",
      "Still feel dry....... not very rich.\n",
      "Love the way it feels and moisturizes.\n",
      "Light gel based lotion...great under make-up or alone. I like it for hot summer days when I still want light and cool moisturizing. In the winter I use it under my cc cream or after I just washed my face before bed. Love that it is not greasy and heavy. Amazon's price is the best I've found\n",
      "One of my fav products.. makes your sdkin feel so hydrated in the morning ..i love it❤\n",
      "just ok, certainly wouldn't buy again, will use on my legs which is what i do with stuff that doesn't do anything for face.  now for the eye cream that i have to review with the face cream,  the eye cream is AWFUL, AWFUL, AWFUL.  THIS STUFF MADE MY EYES ITCH AND EYELIDS AND BELOW EYES SUPER TENDER, I THINK IT MAY HAVE MADE WRINKLES WORSE and yes i did try it multiple times, now it's NO MAS!\n",
      "My face loves this.\n",
      "This is one of the few products where I actually saw it make a difference in my dry skin\n",
      "Not moisturizing enough, not even when I put lots of it on my face or hands. It just doesn't go deep to my real skin. It may leave the top layer feel smooth to touch while the skin still looks cracky. If I use it overnight, my face will feel dry and tight, or even flaky the next day. It also messes with your skin's natural barrier. Overall, I wish I had never used this BS product.\n",
      "Hands down the best face cream I've ever used! I have combination skin and very sensitive skin. This doesn't make my face oily and doesn't burn my skin at all. I have finally found my go to cream! Give it a try!!!\n",
      "Tried several brands of this gel or liquid and like this one the best. Find I'm becoming a Neutrogena fan of their facial products. My face is much less dry and doesn't clog the pores.\n",
      "Really works to keep your skin moisturized.\n",
      "I figured i would give this a try since all others have failed me! This is the best moisturizer I have used and will continue to use this everyday! Feels great going on not heavy at all and solved my dry skin! My face would have dry patches by the middle of the day and very noticeable when i wore makeup. Now since using this product the dry patches are gone! I would highly recommend this product if you have dry skin and it's not oily at all! I can't rave enough after years of searching for a great product for dry skin. Even if you do not have dry skin this moisturizer will work for you! Even my daughter loves it!\n",
      "I do like this product, but my old cream made my skin feel more moisturized throughout the day, but for the price, I would buy recommend!\n",
      "Love so much!  you can feel your skin drink in the moisture!\n",
      "good product.\n",
      "It's hydro, but not for sensitive skin like me, itchy for my first and second time used.  i checked the ingredients, I feel maybe the problems is because of no oil. sensitive skin especially dry sensitive skin needs oil to moisture.  so i used Almond oil before this, it's better now. but i may not buy it again\n",
      "Not as hydrating as I wanted it to be, my skin isn't super dry, but I still felt like I needed more hydration\n",
      "extremely moisturizing! I am ony 40 with very healthy skin but I have a few small scars and am starting to get a few tiny wrinkles. After a week of using this the scars are mostly invisible, the tiny wrinkles are gone and the shadows under my eyes that it didn't advertise to help with are GONE! I love this stuff!! Gentle smell, absorbs very fast cant say enough about it!!\n",
      "I am an argan oil user and have dry skin. I was quite impressed by stellar reviews of this moisturizer and ordered it thinking that it might be good for my dry skin. But sadly this cream has very little moisture. After applying an ample amount on face, my skin still feels dry and I have already shifted back to using argan oil again.\n",
      "Feels great on skin\n",
      "Love this serum! Feels so light and clean on your skin but gives all day moisture.\n",
      "I am always changing products up, but this is one staple that you will ALWAYS find in my bathroom. I was getting a facial one day and the kind esthetician told me I needed a product with \"Hyaluronic Acid\" because my skin was so dry. She also told me not to spend much money because you can find quality moisturizers at a drug store that contain this ingredient (what?!?..win.win). I did a little research when I got home and learned Hyaluronic Acid is not as scary as it sounds and it is actually something your skin produces. Long story short, after purchasing this years ago I have never stopped using it. I put it on first thing when I wake up and can tell an immediate change in my skin. It does make your face feel \"wet\"  for a few minutes so I get my little ones up and let my skin absorb it before putting make-up on. My (use to be) dry face is so thankful for this product!!\n",
      "Very hydrating.\n",
      "I loved this product so much I used too much and my skin turned blue. Careful!Dont use it every day or it tends to dry out your skin a bit. Also dont use several layers like I did. :{I used this all over my face, even above and below my eyes - zero problems.I love this gel and never plan to be without it until I'm turning up the daisies. Great smell and I am hyper sensitive about perfumes and scents.\n",
      "THis stuff is off the charts amazing!! It is so hydrating and perfect for your face!! I put it on day and night and have noticed a difference in my tone and dryness!! Definite MUST!!! highly recommend!!!!\n",
      "I’ve heard such good things about this product, but unfortunately if you’re like me and prone to breakouts it only made it worse. It felt nice when I put it on but it didn’t moisturize as well as I would have liked. It would work better for skin that isn’t prone to breakouts. Also, some of the ingredients in this are not good for your skin.\n",
      "Neutrogena always 5 stars!\n",
      "Cheapest price anywhere for this product!!! I apply every time after washing my face. Love the clean scent and lightweight feel on my skin.\n",
      "I used this for about a month before I just couldn't do it anymore. This moisturized my skin okay, but I'd never go so far as to say it was super hydrating. And it's major plus, which is that it did leave my skin smooth and ready for makeup, is pretty much entirely due to wax, heavy metals, and alcohols. Sadly my skin did *not* like those so much. I didn't 'break out' but I did see a definite rise in congestion from using this product. I'm going back to good ol' sunflower oil.\n",
      "Holy Grail of Moisturizers. Nothing tackles my dry skin as well as this does.\n",
      "Works well for all skin types, not just those with extra dry skin.  The moisture lasts through most of the day - good buy!\n",
      "Not working for me.  Absorbs quickly and does not hydrate for very long.  I had to choose something more substantial - Derma-Nu Aloe Moisture Cream works wonderfully.\n",
      "Love it !\n",
      "Great for dry skin and does not 'burn' my sensitive skin\n",
      "Excellent cream.\n",
      "Returned because it had been previously opened.\n",
      "Perfect for my combination skin. My completion never looked better I'm a 40 year looking 60 year old 😂\n",
      "I usually buy at the store but the price was good and saved me a trip.  It makes your aging skin look hydrated and not too greasy like some do.\n",
      "This review is for the Neutrogena Hydro Boost Water Gel. I have oily, acne-prone skin and I have been using this for a little over a week.Pros:- a little goes a long way- pleasant light scent and consistency- leaves face feeling silky smoothCons:- unhygienic container- unimpressive ingredient list (i.e. the hyaluronic acid [sodium hyaluronate on the list] is near the end)- has the effect of making enlarged pores look even larger (likely due to the hyaluronic acid)- need to use blotting sheets a short while after application- expensive (considering the ingredient list)\n",
      "Applies very smooth,not oily\n",
      "Amazing and refreshing moisture balance. I have given as gifts so bought 7 jars. I use daily and love the results.\n",
      "Large pores run in my family and since I turned 30 they just kept getting bigger. I also started having extremely oily skin. My face would be slick and shiny within a hour of washing. This is the only thing I've tried that visibly makes my pores smaller, even my husband noticed. As an added bonus, my skin is no longer oily. It has a balanced healthy glow all day long. The gel is very light and absorbs quickly. My skins feels soft and clean, not greasy. My skin hasn't looked this good since I was twenty. I love this so much that after trying it for two weeks I sent some to my mom, too.\n",
      "Product color and smell nothing like the product when purchased at the store.\n",
      "Hydrates my face after being outdoors in the sun for a while.\n",
      "Incredible.\n",
      "Changed my skin game\n",
      "So light, and skin feels smooth like a primer.\n",
      "I am 65 and my skin tone was dull but after using this which by the way feels awesome going on , my skin has soften, and my makeup goes on so nicely and at the end of the day still looks great.  Makes tried skin look renewed...love it\n",
      "Satisfied\n",
      "it is not as moisterising as expected\n",
      "This cream is not nearnly as moisturizing as they make it sound to be. Don't waste your money. Look somewhere else!\n",
      "I really love this, goes on smoothly and a little goes a long way.\n",
      "I am 61 years old and my skin is vibrant and glowing!! It feels incredible to put on and it soaks right in. It is a staple in my skin care routine now.\n",
      "After showering or washing your face, use it to trap moisture before using any other product. In the day, use as an under layer before sunscreen.  At night, apply before your regular night cream.  You will wake up with super hydrated skin.\n",
      "Keeps skin moisturized & is light. Nice to put you normal moisturier on top of this.\n",
      "Love! Love! Love! This product has really reduced the wrinkle lines! Will buy again.\n",
      "Definitely seems to moisturize.  However, minus one star because it leaves the face feeling slightly sticky.\n",
      "I have rosacea and my skin is prone to redness and flushing. I was worried about this product because it has a fragrance, but thought I'd give it a try. Scent is much stronger than expected, very perfumey. I like how soft it made my skin feel, but can't continue because it causes my skin to burn and flush. The scent for me is so strong that I'm not sure I could keep using it anyway. I should have stuck to CeraVe or Cetaphil, but am honestly surprised that Neutrogena would put such a strong fragrance in a facial product.\n",
      "This product is excellent. It lives up to its name and hydrates well. It is cold when you apply it. There is no sticky, tacky, feeling and it absorbs into your skin quickly. My skin feels so much better.\n",
      "Excellent. Does everything it promises!\n",
      "Light weight and good for sensitive skin. I really feel like I can see a positive difference\n",
      "I just started using this product 2 months ago. I have a little bit of rosacea. This lotion feels so nice on my skin. It's light and refreshing and it calms my skin down. A little goes a long way. It has no smell. Very nice!\n",
      "This is amazing stuff my grandmother uses if she's 93 years old and she looks very young for her age it's the best product I've seen Ford I'm 48 years old\n",
      "It's ok....I'm not overly impressed.\n",
      "awesome moisturizer for oily/combo skin... SO hydrating and doesn't make you greasy or clog pores. I'd recommend any product from this line!\n",
      "makes my face feel soft and smooth. Half the price of retail box stores.\n",
      "This is the best thing in the world, that's how much I love it. It has made my face which was dry and scaly beautiful..so smooth and clear. Thank you!\n",
      "Two uses made my skin peel\n",
      "This is the 3rd or 4th time I'm buying this. I did research to find a moisturizer that didn't have any acne causing ingredients. A pot lasts me about 2 months of at least one use a day, sometimes twice. I have acne prone combination  skin. It leans toward oily but in the winter it gets dry patches so I went for the extra dry. I don't find it too heavy at all and use it all year long. I haven't tried the regular one to compare them. I will continue to purchase.\n",
      "Good product and price\n",
      "Soft and does what it says!\n",
      "I've been using this gel for almost a month now and my skin is still very dry, didn't help at all. Very bad product, do not buy if you want something to truly hydrates your face.\n",
      "I'm 5 months pregnant with extremely dry skin on my face. I've used pretty much everything imaginable! I bought this as a last hope & omg I haven't looked this good in the last 5 months! Very pleased!\n",
      "Best moisturizer!!! I have neutral skin. Not oily but not dry. Some where in the middle.\n",
      "it's ok but does not last long\n",
      "Feels so silky, penetrates quickly, I've only used for a week at this writing, but so far I like.  I keep in the refrigerator since so hot this summer & really feels good going on cold.\n",
      "Great moisturizer for oily or acne-prone skin. Does a fantastic job moisturizing, without making my skin greasy or clogging pores.\n",
      "This product is no joke! My makeup has never looked better after using the Hydro Boost Gel-Cream. And don't be fooled by it being called a cream – the formula is very light-weight with a great gel texture. It feels amazing to put on.\n",
      "I had dry skin and thought this would help because I used other Neutrogena moisturizers... nahhhh... it burned SO bad! I tried to use it after regular moisturizer but that didn't help either. Maybe my skin was too dry but this product was terrible\n",
      "I was looking for an ULTRA moisturizing/Non greasy face product for my very dry 57 yr old skin and THIS is IT !! I can literally feel my skin drinking it in and it is soooooo soothing and not greasy !!  It just adds a power splash of moisture to your face and is FRAGRANCE FREE which is Great since I cant have anything around my eyes with fragrance or they water..! It has taken away some very persistent dry patches I had on my face which no other face cream would do. I would highly recommend this product and be sure to get it here on Amazon for the best price because I paid $18.89 for it at Kroger...I am anxious to try the eye cream next !!! Thanks Neutrogena !!  GREAT PRODUCT !!!!\n",
      "I honestly could not write a strong enough review for this cream. I lather this stuff on in the morning and before I go to bed at night, and for the first time in years I have felt like my skin is really happy. My dermatologist even said there was a noticeable difference in the moisture content of my skin. I cannot recommend this product highly enough. The best part is that one dot about the size of a fingernail is enough to moisturize the entire face and even the neck if you stretch it. Definitely plan to buy again.\n",
      "Made me break out like crazy.\n",
      "Sadly was unable to use the product... ended up returning it because the box was damaged & the product was already used.\n",
      "It's nice, but I expected my skin to look hydrated and it doesn't.\n",
      "works awesome\n",
      "Almost all of Neutrogena products are 100% effective for facial/skin concerns. Hopefully any reputable dermontologist will tell you so. Never doubt these perfect products if you want results. Ever.\n",
      "I have a face cream drawer filled with products that I used a few times but then they irritated my face, or just did not do the job.  I reluctantly purchased this. Normally even Neutrogena products are too heavy or harsh for my face.  This is not I love it! Cannot beat the price it works better than $100 face creams I have tried. I even notice improvement in my hands.  Must have ... I actually will usd this until it is gone and have already bought another! Dry sensitive skin...you have to try this product.\n",
      "This product is excellent. I really like the gel consistency, this item goes on cool and and smooth as satin. I prefer it to the \"lotion\" style moisturizers that I have always used. The product absorbed right into my skin. My skin absorbed it instantly. My face stayed smooth and hydrated all day, even the areas where my skin was previously prone to dryness. (bridge of nose and eyebrow area), Price was right too, close to $6.00 cheaper than at my local drugstore! Recommend this highly,\n",
      "Skin feels good all day.\n",
      "Love this product! It is light and doesn't feel greasy, makes my face feel soft and smooth! I have been using this product for 3 weeks and I can already see a difference in wrinkles and texture.\n",
      "This product felt so good on my skin and got rid of the flakiness I had from the dry weather. The only issue is the price. I think it's actually cheaper in stores.\n",
      "Great to use moisturizer for daily use on sensitive skin.  Does not feel greasy at all and absorbs almost immediately.  No irritating smell or feel.\n",
      "Great! This is really good. I have oily skin and this is the best I have used. I will continue to purchase.\n",
      "I love this! Today I used this for the first time! It made my skin look so much younger and more supple. My skin was getting very dry this was an instantaneous result. I'll keep using this product and I'll rereview if things change.\n",
      "An amazing lightweight moisturizer. I have oily skin + this is does not make me oily. A little goes a long way - I use about a quarter size for my whole face. Grab this product!!\n",
      "My skin does NOT feel hydrated at all after using this product. I am continuing to use but do use my Butter Drench about 15 minutes after applying.\n",
      "It's perfect for use at night! If I use it in the morning, my makeup doesn't sit well. It's done wonders for my hubby's skin too.\n",
      "The product is just great! I will re order soon, makes my face glow, even under all my makeup.\n",
      "No smell. Goes on nice, i like the consistency of the gel cream, and absorbs quickly. No sticky residue or anything on skin. Leaves skin feeling softDoesnt irritate at all - i have sensitive skin.  Not sure if it will make my skin look improved (i dont think there is any such thing as a miracle cream out there) but I will probably keep using it in hopes of staving off aging and wrinkles.\n",
      "Something about this dries out my face. It feels amazing at first but 5 minutes later my face is so tight. Fortunately it works well for my fiance's dry patches (and it isn't so girly that he is ashamed to use it!)\n",
      "I feel this does help hydrate my eyes but it’s not amazing.\n",
      "This is a nice thick but not greasy cream for the price. I am a Lamer lover and while this isn't on the same level of moisturizing as that is, it is a nice staple\n",
      "Good service and excellent  product\n",
      "It felt refreshing at first, but the second time I used it my skin started to burn. I will try it again to see if the affects change but so far my skin get's irritated by it. ( have sensitive skin)\n",
      "Like this product very much.\n",
      "yes, product arrived as described and saved money from purchasing on amazon instead of buying locally. Product itself is probably not a product i will purchase in the future, but has nothing to do with amazon or seller. Thank you.\n",
      "It’s a nice product it feels good on the skin feels like water seems like it Absorbs pretty well\n",
      "My dermatologist recommended this, and it is luscious and spreads very easily. The only reason for the 4 stars is that it didn't come with a cover on the product itself, and it really looked like it was not full.\n",
      "A friend recommended this and so far, I really like it.\n",
      "Great moisturizer for dry, sensitive skin, it's water based, no smells and hydrates my skin. I'm 42, so my face tends to be dry around my smile lines and chin crease, right below the lip. I have very sensitive skin when it comes to any products and this stuff is a life changer. I absolutely feel the difference in my skin texture after using daily for a week. I am prone to breakouts and with daily washing, followed by using this moisturizer, I've had zero. I apply a dime sized amount all over my face and neck, leaving it damp, rather than rubbing it all in to dry, a little bit really does go a long way. Highly recommended!\n",
      "This is a great lightweight moisturizer. I've been a faithful cera ve user but don't love the consistency. This is a great alternative\n",
      "Great one\n",
      "I really love this product. I started wearing makeup about 3 years ago and I was looking for a moisturizer that could help keep my face soft and cakey-free. This gel cream helped a lot. It replenishes the softness of my skin.\n",
      "Recommended by my dermatologist. I use it everyday. Doesn't make my skin feel greasy.\n",
      "Love it\n",
      "Good!\n",
      "I really love this new line from Neutrogena which has been a perennial favourite go-to-brand for me. For the price, it comes in a generous size. The cream goes on very smoothly without greasy residue and retains moisture in the skin extremely well compared to other high-end lotions I have tried. It glides onto the face very nicely and absorbs right away. There is little-to-no scent so I believe it would be good for those who are sensitive to smells.\n",
      "Just amazing! Very Hydrating ! Highly recommended 👍🏻👍🏻\n",
      "It's a nice moisturizer, doesn't hold up to all the hype, not in my book anyway.\n",
      "Feels amazing on the skin. Like really feels like some high quality brand name Kim K uses it stuff.\n",
      "I'm a little bit confused it's for extra dry skin but when i use it my face still feel dry. But I paired it with another moisturiser and it works like a charm\n",
      "This moisturizer is pretty good. It dries up pretty fast and isn't greasy or oily. There is a lot in the container and lasts about 6 months and I use it every night.Neutrogena Hydro Boost Hyaluronic Acid Hydrating Face Moisturizer Gel-Cream to Hydrate and Smooth Extra-Dry Skin, 1.7 oz\n",
      "This was recommended to me by my dermatologist - and I normally like Neutrogena products.  However, even though I am in my 50's, this one made my sensitive skin break out  - and I did not see any different results from any other previously tried products.\n",
      "I was really hoping for a cooling, yet moisturizing experience. But its mostly just cooling. I wouldn't recommend for those with dry or sensitive skin. Mainly because there are times when I use this after a mask and it burns a bit... The search continues...In my opinion, the ideal buyer would be someone with normal skin to use in the summer months. Definitely not a wintertime winner.\n",
      "Love it.\n",
      "This stuff is awesome!! It works so well! My skin on my cheeks was so dry that it actually hurt to touch. I'm on a gel my dermatologist prescribed for my acne and my other moisturizer wasn't cutting it. I use this mixed with vitamin e oil and my skin is so soft now. I LOVE THIS!\n",
      "It made my skin feel hydrated and soft but I NEVER break out and don't have sensitive skin but it made me break out so bad. I thought maybe it was a coincidence and stopped using it. Started again a couple days ago and had a major break out again.\n",
      "After just having a baby this winter, my poor combination skin has been so dry and irritated. I read so many promising reviews about this on here and was hopeful that it would help my skin retain some of its moisture again. After just one use, there was no change, but I decided to try and give it a chance. So I applied it a few more days to see if it would work. Yet nothing happened. My skin ended up being even more dry than it was before. Plus I broke out on my neck and chin. Sadly I had to return it, but I wish I would have had the same results that others seemed to have had.\n",
      "Not greasy. Hydrates my skin very well.\n",
      "I have an Onexton prescription that works well alone during the summer, but during the winter months I dry out and get frequent breakouts. My doctor gave me some samples of this cream, and when used with the Onexton, my breakouts have 100% stopped. I went from 4 weeks of constant breakouts to 4 weeks of nearly perfect skin, with the addition of this product being the only change. If you need something to balance another medication that dries you out, I would recommend giving this a try.\n",
      "I like how it makes my skin feel but my face is SUPER dry so I end up using a lot of this product. It sinks in quickly after a thick layer but I'll still have dryness so I put another layer on. Glad it works for others but not for this dry face :(\n",
      "I have been using this product for a month now and I absolutely love it. I have extra dry skin because I live in a very dry area and I have thyroid issues. I have tried way too many products only to be disappointed. Neutrogena always seems to be what I go back to. This is by far my favorite.\n",
      "Very cooling on my face in the morning and dries quickly. It's a bit too early to know how effective it will be over time, but happy so far.\n",
      "I LOVED the consistency of this lotion - the feeling on my skin was cooling and light - but it didn't do much for my dryness. I'm hoping that I can use it again during the summer once my winter dryness has cleared up.\n",
      "Very light consistency and it keeps my skin soft for a long time.\n",
      "Not oily feeling, love how it feels on skin\n",
      "Really nice.\n",
      "Love the product.  Have reordered for me, and as a gift for my sister, who also loves it\n",
      "No scent and this is what I need. I so love this product on my skin. Feels so refreshing and it's worth the price! I've been using MAC moisturizer for months but I shall say Neutrogena can replace it. I didn't get break outs and it's very light on my skin while keeping my face moisturized the whole day! I will definitely recommend this to a friend.\n",
      "Such a refreshing creamy boost to my day. Does not break me out like many moisturizers.\n",
      "I bought the Extra Dry Skin cream and it works wonders if you have eczema, you get it on the eyelids, flaky -- just dry skin in general. It's really, really, good. However, I don't know about other people, but I still do recommend it of course cause different things work for different people. You can totally put makeup overthis as well, it dries fast, and doesn't leave you moisty and sticky. For me, it works better than Cetaphil and other Eczema/Psoriasis cure brands. However, I will honestly say it doesn't smell like the regular version of Neutrogena's Hydro Boost Gel cream. I feel since it's for EXTRA dry skin, it is fragrance free.\n",
      "Keep it with me all the time...it really hydrates my face...and it's real dry.Worth every penny..Use in am and pm, then top it off with Cetaphyl for you face..great combo for dry skin.\n",
      "Not exactly like the Sephora brand I like but pretty dang close, for the asking price.\n",
      "I received this product from Influenster for testing purposes. When I found out I was receiving this product.. I was ecstatic! Why? Because I live in Colorado and with this bipolar weather my face has been so dry and flaky. After using it twice a day, I noticed on the 3rd day my face was going back to it's smooth self. I have combination skin, so this product worked out perfect for me. Also, it does have a smell, it's not bad. Kind of smells a bit like Ponds moisturizer.\n",
      "It's a good back up cream\n",
      "Product Looks just as pictured. I have been using this moisturizing gel for a few months now and it does wonders. My skin feels very soft in the morning. The only problem is it is on the costly side and there is not very much in the container.\n",
      "This is my second purchase of the cream.  It feels smooth going on and is not gooey at all and absorbs quickly.  I would recommend it.\n",
      "Product was what it should have been\n",
      "great product\n",
      "I had really dry and flaky skin on and around my nose that just wouldn't go away with any of the moisturizers I had in the past. I just bought this gel cream and it's a godsend. So glad I bought this, less than two days before my flakies were no longer around. I will be buying it again in the future.\n",
      "Great product\n",
      "Purchased these for my mom cause she loves it....\n",
      "My favorite skin care product.\n",
      "I LOVE this product.  Really works.\n",
      "I love this stuff\n",
      "I have historically used \"Neutrogena Ageless Essentials Continuous Hydration - Night\" and that product was wonderful ... but it has been discontinued and can now only be found at ridiculous prices by people taking advantage of the scarcity (seriously - $73.69 for 1.7 ounces?!).  I purchased the Neutrogena Hydro Boost Gel-Cream as a replacement and sadly it fell far short of expectations.  After five days my skin is *much* drier than it was without any moisturizer - so dry it is visibly flaky on my cheeks in the morning after applying the moisturizer at night just before going to bed.  This seems to be an anti-moisturizer - very disappointed!\n",
      "Have been using this morning and evening along with a new face serum and my skin has never felt better. I also applied this moisturizer immediately before doing my bridal makeup for my wedding and my skin absolutely glowed all day. It had that nice dewy look. It has almost a jelly type texture,but not quite. It's hard to describe, but it feels different than normal moisturizers in a good way. You can instantly feel the hydration.\n",
      "Even though its a bit pricey its well worth it..I use this everyday!\n",
      "Was so excited to find a good moisturizer for a lower price. I have keratosis pilaris, and I don't like using the same products for it where it is on my body, versus my face, can cause some issues, especially being used before makeup. I was thrilled that this has glycerin and dimethicone, which are the two holy grail products for getting rid of kp for me. So far, so good! Can't get rid of it, of course, but the redness and bumps have gotten better, even more than when I use my AHA overnight peels\n",
      "Hydrated really well and quick..I was dried out when I got this\n",
      "This is oil free and feels very good to wear. I have sensitive skin, so it breaks out with most face creams. This one is like a gel and my skin has been taking it nicely. I will buy it again!\n",
      "nice but not much difference to the skin\n",
      "Use this daily\n",
      "Great product, since I started using this, my skin has really cleared up as I have certain spots that tend to dry up pretty bad and get flaky, but since I started using this, that no longer happens.\n",
      "My new favorite moisturizer. I have very dry skin on the bottom of my face and around my eyes, but an oily forehead. It's always a struggle to find a moisturizer that adequately moisturizers but doesn't make my face oily by mid-day. Many moisturizers will also tend to clump up and flake, failing to absorb into my skin.This moisturizer is fantastic. It absorbs quickly into my skin and keeps me moisturized all day. Haven't had a problem with flakey skin since I started using it. Also, it doesn't make my face oily!This is my new go-to everyday moisturizer.\n",
      "I have extremely dry skin and always struggle to find a good face cream. If I am not careful about applying lotion/staying hydrated I end up with rough, dry patches on my cheeks. I figured this gel-cream was worth a shot since they boasted about it's hydrating abilities. I definitely noticed a difference while using this. I have since ran out and tried a different brand of gel cream because I couldn't find this and that one is not as good (Garnier). I also like the fact that this cream is unscented and a little goes a long way. It's a little bit more expensive than other Nuetrogena creams but it is worth the price. If you have dry, sensitive skin then this is definitely worth trying out!\n",
      "My favorite face lotion ever, it’s so light, doesn’t feel oily, and does a wonderful job hydrating my dry skin. It’s a little pricey but so worth it and lasts a long time because a little bit goes a long way.\n",
      "My skin is so dry it cracks overnight. This lotion is a like a cool drink of water and soothes my face instantly. I order it every two weeks now.\n",
      "Keeps my skin hydrated when it's on the dryer side.\n",
      "for clean skin\n",
      "I have SUPER oily shiny greasy skin and this gel-cream leave my face feeling fresh, plump and matte. My make up glides on like a dream.... LOVE THIS!!! FOR REAL\n",
      "I always have used creams on my face but in summer I need something lighter but just as effective and this fits the bill. It's not greasy but moisturizer and absorbs fast. Feels nice and cool on the skin.\n",
      "I love this product! I purchased this in April and I still have over half a jar left(a little goes a long way). It leaves my skin soft and smooth. Dries quickly and absorbs without being sticky. I have acne prone skin and I haven't had any break outs since using this. I will continue to use Neutrogena hydro boost. A must have in my daily facial regimen.\n",
      "Great for dry skin, really wish it had scent.\n",
      "I recently moved to Oregon from Georgia and my skin was struggling to stay hydrated. It was patchy and flakey and all around gross. This stuff is amazing. I use it at night and in the morninf after my shower. My skin is smooth and supple and I've recommended it to all my friends.\n",
      "Plain and simple, not hydrating enough! If you have normal skin this would probably be a nice boost for you. If you have dry skin, skip it and spend your money on good stuff. Just because it says hyaluronic acid in it doesn't make it high quality. Sorry Neutrogena! I'm normally a fan!\n",
      "Recommended by a dermatologist. Definitely a holy grail product.\n",
      "I have been using this for about two weeks and have noticed positive changes in the appearance of my skin. Since i have been using this, one person asked me if I was 19. Last night someone asked me if I was 22. No. I am 42. This one is a keeper. Very happy.\n",
      "It feels refreshing, unlike all other products I've tried; soaks right in and keeps feeling good!\n",
      "This cream has helped me with my very dry skin around my nose. I believe that using this for a few more months in the morning and at night will help out alot. Thanks!\n",
      "Despite my sensitive skin, this moisturizer has been a miracle-worker in hydrating my chronically dried out skin. Leaves my face smooth and radiant in ways I've never seen it!\n",
      "This face gel goes on nicely and feels cool once applied.  Lasting effect is not a good as cream.\n",
      "Light weight, great moisturizer. Not heavy or overly greasy.\n",
      "Just starting using it.  Very nice consistency.  Adds good moisture to skin.\n",
      "Great hydration without oiliness or causing breakouts!! Skin seems to be plumper!\n",
      "Recommended by my dermatologist but my face still feels dry and right after applying\n",
      "hydrated face and felt so good.  Will definitely keep buying this product.\n",
      "Love this stuff.  It's my favorite line of moisturizers.  Very light and non-sticky.\n",
      "I cannot say enough good things about this stuff. I have combination skin and certain areas get really dry - this keeps my whole face feeling really good and fresh. I use it every morning and every evening - it also helps puff up bags under your eyes. Lasts much longer than I would expect...I probably go through 1 per month - a little goes a long way!\n",
      "This stuff works, hydrates without clogging pores, you don't have to spend a lot to hydrate, I like it.\n",
      "My skin didn't love this product.  I normally love Nuetrogena products. Not moisturizing enough for me.\n",
      "I have very naturally sensitive, dry, super-fair skin, and this is the first moisturizer that doesn't soak in instantly or leave my face feeling stingy or streaky with unabsorbed product. It's soothing and calming so I don't get any facial redness at all, but instead that dewey \"glow\" I wish my face naturally produced.\n",
      "Perfect, the best.\n",
      "Feels great over my dry skin.\n",
      "It's just OK.\n",
      "I've been using this for several months. It feels wonderful on my skin and people have noticed a difference. Old age glow!\n",
      "I love this moisturizer. Love it. It makes my dry skin feel moisturized without feeling greasy or overly tacky. A little goes a long way.\n",
      "This is the best overall type moisturizer that I have ever bought and used!! It's the only one that doesn't leave me feeling like I've greased my face down and it even goes well under my makeup. I've seen improvement in my overall skin health as well.\n",
      "Saved my skin. A little goes a long way. Rich without being greasy\n",
      "This is great for some heavy moisture, but not good if you plan to apply any makeup within like five hours of use. Also didn't really seem to soak in very well.\n",
      "Works great.\n",
      "Package arrived on time and in good condition. I've used other higher-end face gels that were similar in texture (water based gels) with Hyaluronic Acid, Glycolic acid (i.e. Boscia's Sake Balm, various shisheido products) so I was looking forward to trying this product because it was cheaper and from a trustworthy brand. I used this lotion over the course of three days as my day moisturizer and I can't anymore; the texture of my skin around my lower cheeks, chin and around my mouth completely dried out and has become rough in texture when it was once smooth. I can't explain logically either but my face has a weird tinglyness as well. I stopped using it and gave it to my boyfriend (who is the owner of this Amazon account by the way!) to use it... only one day in and he is also complaining of the same dryness and tinglyness that I am experiencing.I'm pretty disappointed that this product didn't work out for me or my boyfriend, especially seeing how wonderfully it did for others and it would have been a nice way to save some money... unfortunately it doesn't work for everyone. I'm hoping going back to my previous moisturizing routine will restore my skin! For reference, I'm in 30's and have combination (oily in T zone, patchy dryness in winter) and sensitive skin with little to no acne.note: I've attempted to return the face gel to Amazon, but there's no category that accurately applies to having an allergic/negative reaction to a product (closest category was \"product doesn't work\"), which leaves you the choice to do an exchange with Amazon for another product, or return it for full refund. Both of which leave you having to send the lotion back to Amazon which is a bit of a hassle.\n",
      "I love the frangrance free version.  I have sensitive skin, and had no problems with this at all.  Apply to slightly damp skin after cleansing  just before your moisturizer, leaves skin glowing and soft.\n",
      "Moisturizes very well and does not clog my skin.\n",
      "Amazing product. already bought 2 more!\n",
      "I love this moisturizer. It's lightweight and really hydrates your skin. I use it over my Retinol A serum and it helps be sure my face does not get irritated or dry. I would highy recommend it.\n",
      "If they made this fragrance free it would be perfect. I find the smell too strong and irritating.\n",
      "Not very good for very dry skin.  I've tried it every way imaginable and my face is left feeling tight and a lot of dry patches are still visible.  I'm still having to use oil afterwards to not feel or look as flakey and dry afterwards.\n",
      "Love this and the cost on Amazon is lower than at the drug stores. Use it every day on rough patches.\n",
      "makes my skin so soft and noureshes the skin\n",
      "i just feel mislead by what the products promises.However , I have extreamly dry skin so I was really desperate to find something that felt hydrating all day long and gave my skin a youthful glow as it promises. I felt hydrated for about 20 min and then it was gone. I know its a fast absorbing product but its almost as if I didnt put anything on at all and still needed to use an extra facial lotion and primer before applying makeup. i live in michigan so the winters here dry me out and really was hoping to look more youthful with a luminous glow . nope. back to the store it goes\n",
      "Not greasy, use it everyday\n",
      "Love this!\n",
      "super\n",
      "I've been using this product before I go to bed. It really helps with hydrating your skin over night. I was neglecting using moisturizer during my skin care routine, so my skin started breaking out from dehydration. This product helped my thirsty skin drastically!\n",
      "I bought this along with the microdermabrasion system and applied it after using the microdermabrasion system and so far it is working great!  I'm 59 yrs old and it is soothing, soaked right in, and is better than much pricier products I've tried. I would recommend trying this product.\n",
      "Great product but very pricey.  Jar should at least be bigger.  It lasts a long time but it's super expensive.\n",
      "I started to use Hydro Boost for extra dry skin about a year ago. I am very pleased with the way my skin looks. People are surprised to learn my age.\n",
      "best product on the market great moisturizer\n",
      "I didn't notice any big difference in hydration, fine lines, etc. Just another product...\n",
      "This is my favorite face lotion. I live in Utah where it's dry, plus during winter the furnace blowing hot air only adds to it. I have very sensitive skin and used to use Clinique moisture surge, but hated paying their price. I think this does as good as job as the Clinique, but costs about half.\n",
      "I don't feel that it hydrates my skin as much as advertised.  Got the price,  this lotion should do a much better job. Feels okay when applying,  but dries up very quickly.\n",
      "AMAZING for sensitive skin.\n",
      "I love this product!  Great day cream leaves my skin soft with a great clean feeling.\n",
      "I love the way this feels on my skin and I like it better than other high-end products I've used!\n",
      "Living in Phoenix, I am constantly looking for something to hydrate my skin.  I have used oils and various moisturizing products, and I really like this one a lot.  It is my new favorite.  I use it night and day under a basic moisturizer with sunscreen.  On days I am not going out, I just use it alone, and really like the texture of my skin after using it a few weeks now.\n",
      "This stuff is AMAZING. I used to get very dry patches around my lips and on my chin, as well as the tip of my nose, and when I would put on makeup it would get flaky and dry so quickly. The hyaluronic acid in this moisturizer makes your skin turn over faster, leaving less dead skin cells on your face. Long story short, my dry patches are gone. Plus, this smells so clean and feels so nice to put on.\n",
      "Feels nice on the skin and I guess it does hydrate but...it sorta feels like a primer more than a face cream gel. That's why I'm giving it 4 stars. I'll probably buy some more.\n",
      "Great face moisturizer. I love all Neutrogena products. Very affordable and excellent quality. If you have dry skin neutrally or because of other products that dry your skin, this provides the moisture to hidtrate the skin. I use this in combination with Neutrogena oil free moisturizer.\n",
      "It makes my skin itch.\n",
      "Works great on my dry skin before applying my foundation.\n",
      "I use this everyday and it does a great job moisturizing my face without making it greasy.\n",
      "Fantastic product which gives my skin the hydration I need.\n",
      "Delivers hydration as promised.\n",
      "Although recommended by our dermatologist, I thought the cream was rather thin, not very moisturizing.\n",
      "Feels amazing.\n",
      "Not for sensitive skin\n",
      "I was so hoping to like this product but it was a fail. I have dry skin during the winter time and this did not do anything for me sad to say.\n",
      "So soothing. Neutrogena Hydro Boost Gel-Cream feels pure and clean going on and really quenches my skin.I prefer this version (for Extra-Dry Skin) because it has no fragrance or dye (unlike their similar looking \"Water Gel\").This Gel-Cream would deserve 6 stars if it was in a pump dispenser instead of a jar.\n",
      "my favorite night cream.\n",
      "Great product!\n",
      "I'm older and this feels like it looks!  It's a gel that fulls of moisture!\n",
      "Great on my sensitive skin\n",
      "Product as described.  Love this moisturizer.  Happy with my purchase.\n",
      "It’s really watery. It doesn’t do a lot as in hydration for my skin. I impulse bought from a buzzfeed article.\n",
      "Use this with my reg moisturizers in the am and pm and my skins looking great.\n",
      "Great product! A wonderful thirst quencher for your face.  I use it every day under make up and at night with great results after just one month.  Absolutely non comedogenic and great light feeling, so refreshing!  💯 recommended! 👍🏻\n",
      "My skin got more drier than when I first started. I guess it's just not for me\n",
      "great\n",
      "I didn’t quite understand what was so great about this stuff at first. I’d apply it and my face still felt dry 10 mins later. I then heavily gunked on a load of product and let dry and then it worked. I’m not sure how fast I’ll be going through this product at that rate but at least it works now.\n",
      "I first received a sample of this face cream in my Birchbox, I loved it so much that I switched it to my main daily face cream.  What I love the most about Heutrogena Hydro Boost is how easily it soaks into my skin, and then gives my skin that little plump that it needs.  My face is never left sticky and there is no scent to it.  A little goes a long ways, and then leaves my face feeling soft and moisturized.  During the season changes my face had always had a transition time with dry patches.  Between using my Clairsonic and using the Neutrogena Hydro boost gel, I no longer get any dry patches.  The fact that I can get it on subscribe and save through Amazon makes it A+++.\n",
      "great hydrating product.  helps with my dry skin.  feels liquid and creamy at the same time. very pleased.\n",
      "Product exactly as described, you can feel your skin hydrated for hours.\n",
      "Absolutely love this face lotion! It is cool, glides on, moisturizes and leaves no sticky residue.  I immediately stopped using all my more expensive face lotions when I found this.  I'm on my second container and I'm more in love with it than the first day I used it.\n",
      "It is like injecting moisture into your face. The wrinkles are diminished almost from the first application.\n",
      "Same as no 7 Boots and 7Olay  but doesn't cost a fortune. Genuinely leaves skin feeling hydrated.\n",
      "Love the cream! Came perfectly well in the mail, no complaint\n",
      "This is my favorite moisturizer hands down. I've finally broken down and subscribed to have this delivered because I've been using this moisturizer for about 2 years now and I'm just never going back to another kind. I keep a container of the \"extra-dry\" and a container of the regular (and I use the hydro-boost SPF lotion as a combo sunscreen/moisturizer under my makeup). It's safe to say that I've found my holy grail. I don't know why more people don't love this as much as I do. It smells like heaven and feels like you are caressing your face with the love of a thousand happy puppies. It's fantastic and wonderful. If you're looking for a vaseline-level crazy thick \"omg I've been in the sahara for the last month with no water\" type moisturizers, this one is not for you. This is perfect as the final (or second to final if you want to add a moisture night pack) step in a skin care routine focused on light deliciously hydrating layers. But seriously, this sh$% is amazing.I've tried the hydroboost eye cream/gel thing and it's the only product in the original hydroboost line that I would say is disappointing. I haven't tried the new hydroboost face wash (but it's on my list once I run out of the face washes I'm currently using) and I haven't tried the hyaluronic acid serum that they've just released, but I'm expecting to be pleased. Look no further, this stuff is seriously fantastic.And just so y'all know, I received the very first one of these from Influenster like 2.5 years ago and I've loved this stuff ever since. OBVIOUSLY my opinions are my own, but that's how I very first discovered this and it was the best thing I've probably ever gotten for free.\n",
      "I love this product.  It's help reduce the look of fine lines and wrinkles within weeks.  I use it on my face and neck and daily prior to applying my makeup.  I have less forehead wrinkles as well as less lines on my neck.  I had surgery 3 weeks ago on my shoulder and I started to use this on my scars.  I already see a difference in the appearance of the skin.  It was dry and scabby where the stitches were removed and literally after 1 application the scabs are gone and the skin is softer.\n",
      "Hydrates your face!!! Works amazing and cheaper on Amazon than stores.\n",
      "Thank you!\n",
      "I just started using it and I like the lightness of it. My skin looks and feels better already.\n",
      "Works very well\n",
      "Great moisturizer won't leave face greasy\n",
      "I originally received samples of this cream from my Dermatologist, and ultimately ended up buying it because it was so great. Affordable, and most importantly it works great! I used through many stages of my skin; from dry winter skin, to a long vacation where I got a little too much sun, this moisturizer kept my skin balanced without feeling oily at all. Highly recommend!\n",
      "Love this product... work so good\n",
      "Love this cream.  I have purchased both the extra dry and regular versions and like them both.\n",
      "I love this stuff. I have very dry skin and have tried lots of creams, lotions and potions. This has more of a gel consistency than a cream so I thought maybe I wouldn't like it. It is very hydrating and I usually only have to apply once a day.\n",
      "After a week of using this, I became allergic to it.  My face broke out and had knots appear under the skin\n",
      "I love this moisturizer!  I have tried countless products over many years, both expensive and inexpensive.  Neutrogena Hydro Boost Gel-Cream for Extra Dry Skin does exactly what it's supposed to do.  It quenches the skin leaving it soft, supple and moisturized.  It takes only a very small amount to cover your entire face.  It takes a minute or two to soak in leaving no greasy feel and no pilling.  I highly recommend this product for its quality and price point.  The fact that it does not come in a pump dispenser is a little disappointing since it leaves it open to contamination over time.  For that I rated it 4 out of 5 stars.\n",
      "This seems to be working great so far. It doesn't take much to moisturize. However, it is extremely expensive for what it is...but I guess that is the case with most of this stuff. I am using it mainly because my dermatologist recommended i use it.\n",
      "WIFE USES IT ALL THE TIME\n",
      "This Neutrogena cream really hydrates the skin and not only refreshes it, but leaves it extremely soft.  I will definitely purchase a second jar when the one I'm currently using runs out.\n",
      "I previously splurged on Clinique Moisture Surge and thought I'd try this since it's more than half the price. Honestly works just as well if not better - I have combo skin and it made me less oily than the Clinique stuff.\n",
      "I'm really happy with this elegant mosturizer.  I bought it for the Hyaluronic acid content which is a feature of high-priced age reducing products.  I goes on like a gel but quickly melts into a nice mosturizer.  It's not the least bit greasy.\n",
      "Great for acne prone skin! I suffer on/off with cystic acne. This gel hydrates my skin so well! I wake up every morning and my face feels so supple and soft. It also balances my skin tone out quite nicely. I wake up to even toned, plump, soft skin!  I started using this when I was on a BP regimen for my acne, and it really helped to counter the dryness that the BP caused.\n",
      "Works just like the other one, but if u have a dry/oily skin I would probably stick with the regular one.\n",
      "THIN BUT STILL I ENJOYED IT THOROUGHLY =D\n",
      "This really works. Very satisfiedThe dark spot corrector does not pump so have not tried the product.Zinnia seeds have yet to sprout.\n",
      "I'm 57 years old.  I have oily skin and I was kind of nervous about use this product,  like what if doesn't work:  too much oily? Or what if it is too dry on my skin but nope!  I have no problem on this product.  I used morning and night with along any moisture.  To me I think it is wonderful product.\n",
      "Great moisturizer! Neutrogena is a solid skin care brand. You cannot go wrong with this product.\n",
      "Works!\n",
      "2nd one I bought and the lotion is really great.  It isn't thick and pasty but very light and nice to apply.\n",
      "I have sensitive skin and did get a rash for the first week I used this but it got better.  My main issue with it is that it is really not for extra-dry skin.  It's more of a summer moisturizer and cannot keep my winter skin moisturized enough so my nose still gets flaky.  Good for lighter use but wouldn't recommend for truly dry skin.\n",
      "I have INSANELY dry skin, especially during the winter months. I've always had to use a heavy cream moisturizer to relieve my dry skin...so I was very skeptical when it came to this oil free moisturizer. I was thinking, \"no way is this going to moisturize my skin.\" However, I was pleasantly surprised at how well it works! Since I previously had to use a heavy cream, it was brutal during summer months when I would sweat, so I'm excited to be able to use an effective product this summer! It also has a very clean smell, which I really like. I've definitely found my new moisturizer!I received these products complimentary from Influenster for testing purposes, however, this opinion is my own and I truly love using this product.\n",
      "Love how this feels on my skin.  Not greasy. Don't feel that it didn't absorb when I wash my face the next morning. Odorless. Skin feels great.\n",
      "I purchased this product because I had some dryness under my eyebrows and putting my makeup on made my eyebrows look horrible...All the other lotions (except younique divine) broke my face out but this was amazing, Its water based and doesn't feel heavy on my face, I used it the evening I purchased it and before bed and the next morning dryness literally GONE!!! I will never be without this product for a fast fix for dryness especially during the winter....\n",
      "I have roscesa and I had read an article this product would help, wrong.  It was too strong for my face but it did go on nicely.  I receive the product fast and it was packed very well\n",
      "I do not have sensitive skin but it is dry.  This moisturizer didn't moisturizer at all.  It went on smooth and silky but  after 3 weeks of use my skin is dry & flaky, with no observable improvements.  Time to move on - a moisturizer that makes my skin drier is not for me!\n",
      "Totally love this product and it makes my skin feel so soft and smooth.\n",
      "Truly amazing product. I have tried pretty much everything when it comes to face moisturizers, from CeraVe to Dove Men +Care, all of them leave you with a slight greasy feeling after you use them. I have a naturally oily face and this is the first product which I have ever used that moisturized my skin without leaving a greasy feeling. I highly recommend everyone to at least give this product a try.\n",
      "it really does help keep skin hydrated!  Very impressed.\n",
      "It's just alright. I decided to give it a try after reading so many awesome reviews. But after using it for a month, it still leaves my skin dry and blotchy. It's just an O.K. item\n",
      "Its like a sip of cool water on a hot day for my face! I think I finally found the perfect facial moisturizer to be loyal to. I recommend this! Soft texture. Very moisturizing. Absorbs fast. Zero smell. My skin feels happy.\n",
      "BEST MOISTURIZER EVER!I had purchased this a few months ago and it literally saved my skin. I had been using differing gel too often and then used an Alba Botanica moisturizer that caused my skin to breakout in a terrible rash and become even drier. After reading about this online, I bought it at Walgreens and was so impressed! It's really light and extremely moisturizing. The water gel consistency absorbs really well and even works under makeup.When I ran out, it was more expensive in the store so in an effort so save money I switched to a Eucerin redness reducing moisturizer and noticed a significant difference that really made me miss this moisturizer. I went to order it online but BE WARY! I ordered the wrong one and ended up with the Hydro Boost Water Gel which does NOT work nearly as well in my opinion and made my skin burn. This was because the OTHER one had FRAGRANCE and DYE in it - stay away!Anyways, I'll be switching back to the gel cream after spending $40 on other ones that COULD NOT compare. It made my skin soooo smooth and silky, and I really felt that it tightened my skin as well. It makes you glow, doesn't cause acne (clears it if anything) and is SOOO great for super dry skin!!I HIGHLY RECOMMEND\n",
      "Great moisturizer.\n",
      "I have been trying to combat my dry flaky skin for years and had tried tons of products. This gel is the only thing I’ll ever use. It’s a great base under foundation as well\n",
      "My wife says it works great and she uses it all the time. I don't even know what it is or does but, I will go with my wife she is never wrong.\n",
      "My daughter has super dry skin from the medication she is on.  Her dermatologist suggested this, and my daughter loves it.  We tried several over the counter moisturizers as well as prescription moisturizers.  She likes this one.\n",
      "awesome item have re ordered already\n",
      "Like that this one feels a little more substantial but still absorbs quickly.\n",
      "Very nice.  Use all time.  Not at all greasy.\n",
      "I used to use Olay that cost almost $30 or more. This one is just as good as I dislike other creams that are oily.\n",
      "I just received this product this morning, after my shower, I used it for the first time, my face feels great, no dryness, no Rene's, or itchness..so far..great product..satisfied, fast shipping..😉\n",
      "The product worked great when first applied. Unfortunately it only worked for a little while. This product requires re-applying very often during the day. I was not impressed with the product or the price.\n",
      "Love this product! Never really had a problem with dry skin on my face, but we moved to a colder climate 10 months ago and my face had started feeling a bit leathery, mostly on my cheeks along my hairline. Over the past 2 months I tried using several brands of body lotion as well as bought an Olay face lotion, nothing helped. Bought this due to the great reviews and it worked amazing for me. I've only used it twice, yesterday morning and before bedtime, and woke up and my skin is noticeably softer already. I'm 49 years old, haven't had an acne issue since my teens, looks like many of those who wrote low reviews have problems with acne. But I do highly recommend this product for us older gals whose only issue is dryer skin.\n",
      "My pores were small and clean when I started using this...now they're noticeable and full.I'll use up the jar on my chest.\n",
      "Live ut\n",
      "Sub and save.  I have really dry skin and this is the only thing that works.\n",
      "makes my skin feel wonderful.  Ordering a second bottle\n",
      "Only moisturizer I’ve used for 2 years now. Wouldn’t trust anything else.\n",
      "The directions say to apply the cream to cleansed skin. For me, with . . . um . . . mature skin, using it that way resulted in quick absorption and dry skin shortly thereafter. But I've learned that it's a great product used in two other ways:One, I apply it as my skin starts feeling dry during the day. Granted, I don't usually wear face makeup at home, but it does wonders for me this way. I expect I'll be grateful for it this winter.And two, one of my favorite moisturizers (Jason's Ester-C Creme) is a little thick, so I sometimes mix it in my hand first with a dab of the Neutrogena Gel Cream. Smooth!\n",
      "I have oily skin and this works to keep me hydrated but not oily. Good stuff.\n",
      "It helps a lot with dry skin.\n",
      "It feels like aloe vera without the srickiness.\n",
      "Excellent!\n",
      "It's ok. I added a drop of oil. My skin is a bit dry.\n",
      "I don't know if this is the real product, was expired or something caused an allergic reaction but it gave me a red rash that felt like a sunburn.  Be cautious especially if you have sensitive skin.  Returning!\n",
      "I love this as a moisturizer!!! I can't stand the feel of lotion on my skin. I know it's strange but it takes forever to dry. However with this gel it soaks right in, it doesn't make me feel dewy and moist, but it does leave my skin feeling refreshed and hydrated and dries quickly. I've switched over and it's the only moisturizer I use now. Love it! Also can be put on over makeup if you're having a really dry day and doesn't mess up make up if you pat it in.\n",
      "Great product\n",
      "Great\n",
      "maybe a 5 done the road, leave you feeling well hydrated\n",
      "All perfect\n",
      "Love love this little guy!  My skin is so hydrated and feels so healthy in the morning.  I only use this before bedtime.  I took one star off because my skin feels a bit sticky after I apply the cream.. but the result is awesome so I don't mind at all.  Highly recommended!\n",
      "Love Neutrogena Hydro boost,  this moisturizer is soft and absorbs well without any residual greasy feeling.  I discovered this as a solution to dry skin from chemo treatments that affect the skin.  This was the only moisturizer that was relieving the dryness.  Highly recommend and will purchase again.\n",
      "Love it!\n",
      "Doesn't really do anything for me. it dried quickly but it did not leave skin soft and hydrated. I need thicker lotions for extremely dry skin\n",
      "Hard to describe as it's a bit wetter and frankly goopier than I expected so I use it after my Lightstim treatment and on my decleor where I'm starting to see early sighns of damaged skin from too much unprotected sun.\n",
      "worst cream ever... does not \"hydro-boost\" my skin, my skin was dry and after applying this still remains dry...bad bad bad gel-cream..i hate neutrogena now!\n",
      "customer didn't like it\n",
      "It's pretty good. But it's not for you if you need a lot of moisture into your skin. It's very lightweight .\n",
      "No better than any other face cream I've tried, but yet cost a lot more. No thanks.\n",
      "WAY too much water in this product leaving nothing to actually benefit the skin.  It's a big jar with only a tiny dab of product, 1.7 oz.  I honestly can't find the words to describe what 3 months of this did to my face - I was using it out of desperation because of being allergic to everything in the sun and can't find another product I can use.  I've used Neutrogena Ageless Essentials for years and was very happy with it.  Then they stopped making it.  I talked to a rep at Neutrogena saying I needed something with the same properties, detailing age and skin dryness and sensitivity, and was told to use this, that it would replace the other.  It felt good at first, but the longer I used it the drier my face became, until I was having to apply it multiple times a day but it would just disappear quickly  leaving my face even drier and itchy with some red sore spots that burned and itched.  A jar was only lasting about a week.  Meanwhile something really strange was happening to my skin, it felt like it was disintegrating or disappearing, to the point I think the product was actually doing what tanning leather does, making it thin with a hard surface.  I found some leftover Ageless Essentials on ebay, and even though it's a couple of years old in just 2 days my face feels like it's reviving and may soon be normal again.  Maybe if Neutrogena left out some of the water it would actually work on dry skin???  I hope somebody at Neutrogena reads reviews and will think about bringing back something similar to Ageless Essentials.\n",
      "This is the only moisturizer I have found that works without breaking me out! I have very acne-prone sensitive skin that was extremely dehydrated from years of improper use of acne medication and this has helped tremendously in making my skin normal again. I use this on my face every day after showering.Seriously, this stuff is amazing.\n",
      "Great cream, very liquid feeling not heavy at all and no residue. Makeup goes on smooth after.\n",
      "This was cheaper than at Wal-Mart.  I,love this Neutrogena moistuizer.  One of the best out there.  I will absolutely buy this again.UPDATE 7/29/17I have bought this 3 times now and love it.  My skin is so soft and moisturized.  Out of all my skin regime items, I always use this up the fastest.  And Neutrogena company is amazing!!!\n",
      "I started using this gel about 3 months ago -- wanted something light and not oily - just needed some extra moisture on my skin after the long winter.  I'm 49 yrs old.  My skin is Combination - with a few fine lines starting to show.  I am so impressed with how my skin feels lately.  Last week a coworker said my skin looks so great and asked what I was using.  My face has a healthy glow lately.  Even my daughter said my skin feels so smooth to the touch.  I'll continue using this for the summer but I'll need to apply Neutrogena Face Sunscreen SPF 30 -- the stick works great under makeup.  Thanks for a great moisturizer!\n",
      "I have been using this product for 6 months and it works really well with my skin. I have been able to see and feel a significant, positive difference in the health of my skin since using this product. I loved it so much that I bought the gel eye cream as well.\n",
      "I love gel creams, and this one is the perfect balance of hydration without feeling greasy or heavy. It's super light weight! I have dry-combo, sensitive acne prone skin and this is perfect for the humid weather I'm in. In the cold/drier months, or if my skin is extra dry for whatever reason, I feel like this alone isn't enough however. If not, I make sure to use a face oil before, or slather a thicker moisturizer after. I still recommend it though!\n",
      "LOVE LOVE  LOVE this product! I swear by Neutrogena products\n",
      "WOW.  So, I didn't buy this product expect it to be a miracle worker, but ...I am 30 years old and raised in Florida.  I'm not sure whether it's age or moving north that has caused the problem, but in the wintertime I suffer from extremely dry skin, especially around my eyes and under my chin.  I was noticing that the dryness was giving this skin a wrinkled, crepe-y appearance that made me look much older, so I decided I needed to invest in a better moisturizer.  I'm an Amazon addict, so I came here first looking for an under-eye moisturizer.  I was specifically looking for something that was gentle and frangrance-free, since I have sensitive skin, especially around my eyes.After reading the reviews for this product (and the helpful one that explained that the extra-dry skin gel-cream had the same ingredients as the eye gel-cream for cheaper), I decided to give this a try.  Compared to my usual moisturizer cost of $30 for 16oz, this was a big investment, but I figured if it didn't work it was only $15 out of pocket.After two weeks of using it, I can say that I will DEFINITELY be purchasing this product again.  Not only has it solved my dry skin problems around my eyes and neck, but I have been applying to the rest of my face at night before bed (I used a lighter weight moisturizer on the rest of my face during the day).  I've found that my skin overall is smoother and the skin tone more even after a couple weeks of using this product.  I struggle with adult acne on my chin/cheeks and have not had any breakouts and in fact may actually be getting fewer zits since starting this routine.I will note that you should be careful applying this around your eyes.  I've found that if I get any of the gel in my eyelashes, it will migrate into my eyes and cause a slight irritation.  It's less than other products I have used, but still noticeable.Update 2/22/2017: I've been using this for almost two months now and my original jar is just starting to run out.  I am still blown away by how well this moisturizes.  Regarding my acne, although I still get occasional breakouts, any problem spots heal much faster using this moisturizer - red spots fade and disappear over the course of a couple of days, rather than a couple of weeks.  I will definitely be continuing to use this - I've subscribed to have a new jar sent from Amazon every other month!\n",
      "If you like Clinque Moisture Surge you will love this. Very light and doesn't clog pores. Good for humid climates.\n",
      "This product gives my face so much moister. I absolutly love it.\n",
      "best one for my extra dry skin\n",
      "The packaging says for \"Extra Dry Skin\". The moisturizer is NOT at all Hydrating. I had to apply other moisturizer on top. Some youtubers compare it to Clinique Moisture surge....IT's NOT AT ALL comparable. Clinique moisture surge is AMAZING and very hydrating.I will NOT repurchase this again.\n",
      "Worst product ever. My skin is extra dry but after applying this product I could not see any difference. I have to apply some moisturizer even after applying this gel. This product is of no use. Total waste of money. I wish I could get my money back.\n",
      "excellent good price too\n",
      "This has to be the best thing I have ever used on my face. It sinks into my skin super fast and leaves it like silk less than a minute later. Not even my favourite moisturizer works this well. I cannot stop touching my face it's that soft\n",
      "I've been coasting on the fact that my co-workers think I'm 8 years younger than I actually am, but each year the ruse gets harder. This cream is amazing -- it really plumps the skin to fill in those little lines that show your real age. Skin looks great. No breakouts. Doesn't costs huge money, so I will continue to use it. A little goes along way. I use this in concert with a moisturizing sunscreen for day use, and I think the container will last 3 -4 months if used sparingly.\n",
      "I received a free full size jar of Neutrogena Hydro Boost water gel from Influenster about two months ago and I have been using it every day since in place of my normal clean and clear lotion routine. I must admit, it is amazing. It goes on very smooth and absorbs really quickly. It does have a strong fragrance in the jar, but it quickly dissipates after its rubbed in. I've been using it every day for two months and I still have a half of a jar left- so even though the price is a little on the high side, it lasts for long enough to be worth it! My skin is generally on the dry end of the spectrum and this lotion really quenched my skin quickly and lasted the whole day. I also have noticed that I haven't gotten my normal monthly break outs since I have been using this, my skin is beautiful and clear.\n",
      "All the hype about this, I was not impressed the least.  I did finish using the jar since I had already opened it but can't say I saw a difference in my skin after using it. my skin is pretty normal, maybe slighter dryer in the winter but then, whose isn't, right? I believe it lasted a month or so of using it once a day ( I do have a night cream). I didn't find this moisturizing, on the contrary, it left my face sort of parched? will not buy again.\n",
      "All you're getting with this product is the Name and Hype. I have extremely parched dry skin in the winter. I heard so many rave reviews on this product. Save your money. It doesn't deliver continuous moisture as it claims. It does feel good and cooling going on. It would be awesome for someone with Normal skin. It would also be great for sensitive skin in need of pampering. But those of us with extremely dry facial skin it is not the cream/gel you're in search of. I'm in a constant struggle to locate a proper, affordable facial cream for winter dryness. This was not it.\n",
      "I love this product. I have very dry skin and this gel cream really puts the moisture back. I just reordered!\n",
      "My dermatologist recommended this, and now I can't imagine using anything else. Not sticky, very soothing and easy to apply, and my skin is happier now.\n",
      "Seems to be working. Put it on in the morning the next day my face looked smoother.\n",
      "Love the smooth feeling it gives every night I use it.\n"
